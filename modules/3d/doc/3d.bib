  abstract = {
    KinectFusion enables a user holding and moving a standard Kinect camera to rapidly create detailed 3D reconstructions of an indoor scene.
    Only the depth data from Kinect is used to track the 3D pose of the sensor and reconstruct, geometrically precise, 3D models of the physical scene in real-time.
    The capabilities of KinectFusion, as well as the novel GPU-based pipeline are described in full. We show uses of the core system for low-cost handheld scanning,
    and geometry-aware augmented reality and physics-based interactions. Novel extensions to the core GPU pipeline demonstrate object segmentation and user interaction directly
    in front of the sensor, without degrading camera tracking or reconstruction. These extensions are used to enable real-time multi-touch interactions anywhere,
    allowing any planar or non-planar reconstructed physical surface to be appropriated for touch.
