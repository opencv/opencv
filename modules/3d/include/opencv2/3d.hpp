/**
  @defgroup _3d 3D vision functionality

Most of the functions in this section use a so-called pinhole camera model. The view of a scene
is obtained by projecting a scene's 3D point \f$P_w\f$ into the image plane using a perspective
transformation which forms the corresponding pixel \f$p\f$. Both \f$P_w\f$ and \f$p\f$ are
represented in homogeneous coordinates, i.e. as 3D and 2D homogeneous vector respectively. You will
find a brief introduction to projective geometry, homogeneous vectors and homogeneous
transformations at the end of this section's introduction. For more succinct notation, we often drop
the 'homogeneous' and say vector instead of homogeneous vector.

The distortion-free projective transformation given by a  pinhole camera model is shown below.

\f[s \; p = A \begin{bmatrix} R|t \end{bmatrix} P_w,\f]

where \f$P_w\f$ is a 3D point expressed with respect to the world coordinate system,
\f$p\f$ is a 2D pixel in the image plane, \f$A\f$ is the camera intrinsic matrix,
\f$R\f$ and \f$t\f$ are the rotation and translation that describe the change of coordinates from
world to camera coordinate systems (or camera frame) and \f$s\f$ is the projective transformation's
arbitrary scaling and not part of the camera model.

The camera intrinsic matrix \f$A\f$ (notation used as in @cite Zhang2000 and also generally notated
as \f$K\f$) projects 3D points given in the camera coordinate system to 2D pixel coordinates, i.e.

\f[p = A P_c.\f]

The camera intrinsic matrix \f$A\f$ is composed of the focal lengths \f$f_x\f$ and \f$f_y\f$, which are
expressed in pixel units, and the principal point \f$(c_x, c_y)\f$, that is usually close to the
image center:

\f[A = \vecthreethree{f_x}{0}{c_x}{0}{f_y}{c_y}{0}{0}{1},\f]

and thus

\f[s \vecthree{u}{v}{1} = \vecthreethree{f_x}{0}{c_x}{0}{f_y}{c_y}{0}{0}{1} \vecthree{X_c}{Y_c}{Z_c}.\f]

The matrix of intrinsic parameters does not depend on the scene viewed. So, once estimated, it can
be re-used as long as the focal length is fixed (in case of a zoom lens). Thus, if an image from the
camera is scaled by a factor, all of these parameters need to be scaled (multiplied/divided,
respectively) by the same factor.

The joint rotation-translation matrix \f$[R|t]\f$ is the matrix product of a projective
transformation and a homogeneous transformation. The 3-by-4 projective transformation maps 3D points
represented in camera coordinates to 2D points in the image plane and represented in normalized
camera coordinates \f$x' = X_c / Z_c\f$ and \f$y' = Y_c / Z_c\f$:

\f[Z_c \begin{bmatrix}
x' \\
y' \\
1
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
X_c \\
Y_c \\
Z_c \\
1
\end{bmatrix}.\f]

The homogeneous transformation is encoded by the extrinsic parameters \f$R\f$ and \f$t\f$ and
represents the change of basis from world coordinate system \f$w\f$ to the camera coordinate sytem
\f$c\f$. Thus, given the representation of the point \f$P\f$ in world coordinates, \f$P_w\f$, we
obtain \f$P\f$'s representation in the camera coordinate system, \f$P_c\f$, by

\f[P_c = \begin{bmatrix}
R & t \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix} P_w,\f]

This homogeneous transformation is composed out of \f$R\f$, a 3-by-3 rotation matrix, and \f$t\f$, a
3-by-1 translation vector:

\f[\begin{bmatrix}
R & t \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
r_{11} & r_{12} & r_{13} & t_x \\
r_{21} & r_{22} & r_{23} & t_y \\
r_{31} & r_{32} & r_{33} & t_z \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix},
\f]

and therefore

\f[\begin{bmatrix}
X_c \\
Y_c \\
Z_c \\
1
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
r_{11} & r_{12} & r_{13} & t_x \\
r_{21} & r_{22} & r_{23} & t_y \\
r_{31} & r_{32} & r_{33} & t_z \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
X_w \\
Y_w \\
Z_w \\
1
\end{bmatrix}.\f]

Combining the projective transformation and the homogeneous transformation, we obtain the projective
transformation that maps 3D points in world coordinates into 2D points in the image plane and in
normalized camera coordinates:

\f[Z_c \begin{bmatrix}
x' \\
y' \\
1
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} R|t \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
X_w \\
Y_w \\
Z_w \\
1
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
r_{11} & r_{12} & r_{13} & t_x \\
r_{21} & r_{22} & r_{23} & t_y \\
r_{31} & r_{32} & r_{33} & t_z
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
X_w \\
Y_w \\
Z_w \\
1
\end{bmatrix},\f]

with \f$x' = X_c / Z_c\f$ and \f$y' = Y_c / Z_c\f$. Putting the equations for instrincs and extrinsics together, we can write out
\f$s \; p = A \begin{bmatrix} R|t \end{bmatrix} P_w\f$ as

\f[s \vecthree{u}{v}{1} = \vecthreethree{f_x}{0}{c_x}{0}{f_y}{c_y}{0}{0}{1}
\begin{bmatrix}
r_{11} & r_{12} & r_{13} & t_x \\
r_{21} & r_{22} & r_{23} & t_y \\
r_{31} & r_{32} & r_{33} & t_z
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
X_w \\
Y_w \\
Z_w \\
1
\end{bmatrix}.\f]

If \f$Z_c \ne 0\f$, the transformation above is equivalent to the following,

\f[\begin{bmatrix}
u \\
v
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
f_x X_c/Z_c + c_x \\
f_y Y_c/Z_c + c_y
\end{bmatrix}\f]

with

\f[\vecthree{X_c}{Y_c}{Z_c} = \begin{bmatrix}
R|t
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
X_w \\
Y_w \\
Z_w \\
1
\end{bmatrix}.\f]

The following figure illustrates the pinhole camera model.

![Pinhole camera model](pics/pinhole_camera_model.png)

Real lenses usually have some distortion, mostly radial distortion, and slight tangential distortion.
So, the above model is extended as:

\f[\begin{bmatrix}
u \\
v
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
f_x x'' + c_x \\
f_y y'' + c_y
\end{bmatrix}\f]

where

\f[\begin{bmatrix}
x'' \\
y''
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
x' \frac{1 + k_1 r^2 + k_2 r^4 + k_3 r^6}{1 + k_4 r^2 + k_5 r^4 + k_6 r^6} + 2 p_1 x' y' + p_2(r^2 + 2 x'^2) + s_1 r^2 + s_2 r^4 \\
y' \frac{1 + k_1 r^2 + k_2 r^4 + k_3 r^6}{1 + k_4 r^2 + k_5 r^4 + k_6 r^6} + p_1 (r^2 + 2 y'^2) + 2 p_2 x' y' + s_3 r^2 + s_4 r^4 \\
\end{bmatrix}\f]

with

\f[r^2 = x'^2 + y'^2\f]

and

\f[\begin{bmatrix}
x'\\
y'
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
X_c/Z_c \\
Y_c/Z_c
\end{bmatrix},\f]

if \f$Z_c \ne 0\f$.

The distortion parameters are the radial coefficients \f$k_1\f$, \f$k_2\f$, \f$k_3\f$, \f$k_4\f$, \f$k_5\f$, and \f$k_6\f$
,\f$p_1\f$ and \f$p_2\f$ are the tangential distortion coefficients, and \f$s_1\f$, \f$s_2\f$, \f$s_3\f$, and \f$s_4\f$,
are the thin prism distortion coefficients. Higher-order coefficients are not considered in OpenCV.

The next figures show two common types of radial distortion: barrel distortion
(\f$ 1 + k_1 r^2 + k_2 r^4 + k_3 r^6 \f$ monotonically decreasing)
and pincushion distortion (\f$ 1 + k_1 r^2 + k_2 r^4 + k_3 r^6 \f$ monotonically increasing).
Radial distortion is always monotonic for real lenses,
and if the estimator produces a non-monotonic result,
this should be considered a calibration failure.
More generally, radial distortion must be monotonic and the distortion function must be bijective.
A failed estimation result may look deceptively good near the image center
but will work poorly in e.g. AR/SFM applications.
The optimization method used in OpenCV camera calibration does not include these constraints as
the framework does not support the required integer programming and polynomial inequalities.
See [issue #15992](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/15992) for additional information.

![](pics/distortion_examples.png)
![](pics/distortion_examples2.png)

In some cases, the image sensor may be tilted in order to focus an oblique plane in front of the
camera (Scheimpflug principle). This can be useful for particle image velocimetry (PIV) or
triangulation with a laser fan. The tilt causes a perspective distortion of \f$x''\f$ and
\f$y''\f$. This distortion can be modeled in the following way, see e.g. @cite Louhichi07.

\f[\begin{bmatrix}
u \\
v
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
f_x x''' + c_x \\
f_y y''' + c_y
\end{bmatrix},\f]

where

\f[s\vecthree{x'''}{y'''}{1} =
\vecthreethree{R_{33}(\tau_x, \tau_y)}{0}{-R_{13}(\tau_x, \tau_y)}
{0}{R_{33}(\tau_x, \tau_y)}{-R_{23}(\tau_x, \tau_y)}
{0}{0}{1} R(\tau_x, \tau_y) \vecthree{x''}{y''}{1}\f]

and the matrix \f$R(\tau_x, \tau_y)\f$ is defined by two rotations with angular parameter
\f$\tau_x\f$ and \f$\tau_y\f$, respectively,

\f[
R(\tau_x, \tau_y) =
\vecthreethree{\cos(\tau_y)}{0}{-\sin(\tau_y)}{0}{1}{0}{\sin(\tau_y)}{0}{\cos(\tau_y)}
\vecthreethree{1}{0}{0}{0}{\cos(\tau_x)}{\sin(\tau_x)}{0}{-\sin(\tau_x)}{\cos(\tau_x)} =
\vecthreethree{\cos(\tau_y)}{\sin(\tau_y)\sin(\tau_x)}{-\sin(\tau_y)\cos(\tau_x)}
{0}{\cos(\tau_x)}{\sin(\tau_x)}
{\sin(\tau_y)}{-\cos(\tau_y)\sin(\tau_x)}{\cos(\tau_y)\cos(\tau_x)}.
\f]

In the functions below the coefficients are passed or returned as

\f[(k_1, k_2, p_1, p_2[, k_3[, k_4, k_5, k_6 [, s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4[, \tau_x, \tau_y]]]])\f]

vector. That is, if the vector contains four elements, it means that \f$k_3=0\f$ . The distortion
coefficients do not depend on the scene viewed. Thus, they also belong to the intrinsic camera
parameters. And they remain the same regardless of the captured image resolution. If, for example, a
camera has been calibrated on images of 320 x 240 resolution, absolutely the same distortion
coefficients can be used for 640 x 480 images from the same camera while \f$f_x\f$, \f$f_y\f$,
\f$c_x\f$, and \f$c_y\f$ need to be scaled appropriately.

The functions below use the above model to do the following:

-   Project 3D points to the image plane given intrinsic and extrinsic parameters.
-   Compute extrinsic parameters given intrinsic parameters, a few 3D points, and their
projections.
-   Estimate intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters from several views of a known calibration
pattern (every view is described by several 3D-2D point correspondences).
-   Estimate the relative position and orientation of the stereo camera "heads" and compute the
*rectification* transformation that makes the camera optical axes parallel.

<B> Homogeneous Coordinates </B><br>
Homogeneous Coordinates are a system of coordinates that are used in projective geometry. Their use
allows to represent points at infinity by finite coordinates and simplifies formulas when compared
to the cartesian counterparts, e.g. they have the advantage that affine transformations can be
expressed as linear homogeneous transformation.

One obtains the homogeneous vector \f$P_h\f$ by appending a 1 along an n-dimensional cartesian
vector \f$P\f$ e.g. for a 3D cartesian vector the mapping \f$P \rightarrow P_h\f$ is:

\f[\begin{bmatrix}
X \\
Y \\
Z
\end{bmatrix} \rightarrow \begin{bmatrix}
X \\
Y \\
Z \\
1
\end{bmatrix}.\f]

For the inverse mapping \f$P_h \rightarrow P\f$, one divides all elements of the homogeneous vector
by its last element, e.g. for a 3D homogeneous vector one gets its 2D cartesian counterpart by:

\f[\begin{bmatrix}
X \\
Y \\
W
\end{bmatrix} \rightarrow \begin{bmatrix}
X / W \\
Y / W
\end{bmatrix},\f]

if \f$W \ne 0\f$.

Due to this mapping, all multiples \f$k P_h\f$, for \f$k \ne 0\f$, of a homogeneous point represent
the same point \f$P_h\f$. An intuitive understanding of this property is that under a projective
transformation, all multiples of \f$P_h\f$ are mapped to the same point. This is the physical
observation one does for pinhole cameras, as all points along a ray through the camera's pinhole are
projected to the same image point, e.g. all points along the red ray in the image of the pinhole
camera model above would be mapped to the same image coordinate. This property is also the source
for the scale ambiguity s in the equation of the pinhole camera model.

As mentioned, by using homogeneous coordinates we can express any change of basis parameterized by
\f$R\f$ and \f$t\f$ as a linear transformation, e.g. for the change of basis from coordinate system
0 to coordinate system 1 becomes:

\f[P_1 = R P_0 + t \rightarrow P_{h_1} = \begin{bmatrix}
R & t \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix} P_{h_0}.\f]

@note
    -   Many functions in this module take a camera intrinsic matrix as an input parameter. Although all
        functions assume the same structure of this parameter, they may name it differently. The
        parameter's description, however, will be clear in that a camera intrinsic matrix with the structure
        shown above is required.

A Levenberg-Marquadt algorithm locally minimizes an objective function value (aka energy, cost or error) starting from

To do that, at each iteration it repeatedly calculates the energy at probe points until it's reduced.
To calculate a probe point, a linear equation is solved: (J^T*J + lambda*D)*dx = -J^T*b where J is a function jacobian,
b is a vector of residuals (aka errors or energy terms), D is a diagonal matrix generated from J^T*J diagonal
and lambda changes for each probe point. Then the resulting dx is "added" to current variable and it forms
a probe value. "Added" is quoted because in some groups (e.g. SO(3) group) such an increment can be a non-trivial operation.

For more details, please refer to Wikipedia page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenberg%E2%80%93Marquardt_algorithm).

This solver supports fixed variables and two forms of callback function:
1. Generating ordinary jacobian J and residual vector err ("long")
2. Generating normal equation matrix J^T*J and gradient vector J^T*err

Currently the solver supports dense jacobian matrix and linear parameter increment.

/** @brief Finds a perspective transformation between two planes.

@param srcPoints Coordinates of the points in the original plane, a matrix of the type CV_32FC2
or vector\<Point2f\> .
@param dstPoints Coordinates of the points in the target plane, a matrix of the type CV_32FC2 or
a vector\<Point2f\> .
@param method Method used to compute a homography matrix. The following methods are possible:
-   **0** - a regular method using all the points, i.e., the least squares method
-   @ref RANSAC - RANSAC-based robust method
-   @ref LMEDS - Least-Median robust method
-   @ref RHO - PROSAC-based robust method
@param ransacReprojThreshold Maximum allowed reprojection error to treat a point pair as an inlier
(used in the RANSAC and RHO methods only). That is, if
\f[\| \texttt{dstPoints} _i -  \texttt{convertPointsHomogeneous} ( \texttt{H} \cdot \texttt{srcPoints} _i) \|_2  >  \texttt{ransacReprojThreshold}\f]
then the point \f$i\f$ is considered as an outlier. If srcPoints and dstPoints are measured in pixels,
it usually makes sense to set this parameter somewhere in the range of 1 to 10.
@param mask Optional output mask set by a robust method ( RANSAC or LMeDS ). Note that the input
mask values are ignored.
@param maxIters The maximum number of RANSAC iterations.
@param confidence Confidence level, between 0 and 1.

The function finds and returns the perspective transformation \f$H\f$ between the source and the
destination planes:

\f[s_i  \vecthree{x'_i}{y'_i}{1} \sim H  \vecthree{x_i}{y_i}{1}\f]

so that the back-projection error

\f[\sum _i \left ( x'_i- \frac{h_{11} x_i + h_{12} y_i + h_{13}}{h_{31} x_i + h_{32} y_i + h_{33}} \right )^2+ \left ( y'_i- \frac{h_{21} x_i + h_{22} y_i + h_{23}}{h_{31} x_i + h_{32} y_i + h_{33}} \right )^2\f]

is minimized. If the parameter method is set to the default value 0, the function uses all the point
pairs to compute an initial homography estimate with a simple least-squares scheme.

However, if not all of the point pairs ( \f$srcPoints_i\f$, \f$dstPoints_i\f$ ) fit the rigid perspective
transformation (that is, there are some outliers), this initial estimate will be poor. In this case,
you can use one of the three robust methods. The methods RANSAC, LMeDS and RHO try many different
random subsets of the corresponding point pairs (of four pairs each, collinear pairs are discarded), estimate the homography matrix
using this subset and a simple least-squares algorithm, and then compute the quality/goodness of the
computed homography (which is the number of inliers for RANSAC or the least median re-projection error for
LMeDS). The best subset is then used to produce the initial estimate of the homography matrix and
the mask of inliers/outliers.

Regardless of the method, robust or not, the computed homography matrix is refined further (using
inliers only in case of a robust method) with the Levenberg-Marquardt method to reduce the
re-projection error even more.

The methods RANSAC and RHO can handle practically any ratio of outliers but need a threshold to
distinguish inliers from outliers. The method LMeDS does not need any threshold but it works
correctly only when there are more than 50% of inliers. Finally, if there are no outliers and the
noise is rather small, use the default method (method=0).

The function is used to find initial intrinsic and extrinsic matrices. Homography matrix is
determined up to a scale. If \f$h_{33}\f$ is non-zero, the matrix is normalized so that \f$h_{33}=1\f$.
@note Whenever an \f$H\f$ matrix cannot be estimated, an empty one will be returned.

@see @ref calib3d_solvePnP

This function returns the rotation and the translation vectors that transform a 3D point expressed in the object
coordinate frame to the camera coordinate frame, using different methods:
- P3P methods (@ref SOLVEPNP_P3P, @ref SOLVEPNP_AP3P): need 4 input points to return a unique solution.
- @ref SOLVEPNP_IPPE Input points must be >= 4 and object points must be coplanar.
- @ref SOLVEPNP_IPPE_SQUARE Special case suitable for marker pose estimation.
Number of input points must be 4. Object points must be defined in the following order:
  - point 0: [-squareLength / 2,  squareLength / 2, 0]
  - point 1: [ squareLength / 2,  squareLength / 2, 0]
  - point 2: [ squareLength / 2, -squareLength / 2, 0]
  - point 3: [-squareLength / 2, -squareLength / 2, 0]
- for all the other flags, number of input points must be >= 4 and object points can be in any configuration.

@param objectPoints Array of object points in the object coordinate space, Nx3 1-channel or
1xN/Nx1 3-channel, where N is the number of points. vector\<Point3d\> can be also passed here.
@param imagePoints Array of corresponding image points, Nx2 1-channel or 1xN/Nx1 2-channel,
where N is the number of points. vector\<Point2d\> can be also passed here.
@param cameraMatrix Input camera intrinsic matrix \f$\cameramatrix{A}\f$ .
@param distCoeffs Input vector of distortion coefficients
\f$\distcoeffs\f$. If the vector is NULL/empty, the zero distortion coefficients are
assumed.
@param rvec Output rotation vector (see @ref Rodrigues ) that, together with tvec, brings points from
the model coordinate system to the camera coordinate system.
@param tvec Output translation vector.
@param useExtrinsicGuess Parameter used for #SOLVEPNP_ITERATIVE. If true (1), the function uses
the provided rvec and tvec values as initial approximations of the rotation and translation
vectors, respectively, and further optimizes them.
@param flags Method for solving a PnP problem: see @ref calib3d_solvePnP_flags

   -   An example of how to use solvePnP for planar augmented reality can be found at
        opencv_source_code/samples/python/plane_ar.py
   -   If you are using Python:
        - Numpy array slices won't work as input because solvePnP requires contiguous
        arrays (enforced by the assertion using cv::Mat::checkVector() around line 55 of
        modules/3d/src/solvepnp.cpp version 2.4.9)
        - The P3P algorithm requires image points to be in an array of shape (N,1,2) due
        to its calling of #undistortPoints (around line 75 of modules/3d/src/solvepnp.cpp version 2.4.9)
        which requires 2-channel information.
        - Thus, given some data D = np.array(...) where D.shape = (N,M), in order to use a subset of
        it as, e.g., imagePoints, one must effectively copy it into a new array: imagePoints =
        np.ascontiguousarray(D[:,:2]).reshape((N,1,2))
   -   The methods @ref SOLVEPNP_DLS and @ref SOLVEPNP_UPNP cannot be used as the current implementations are
       unstable and sometimes give completely wrong results. If you pass one of these two
       flags, @ref SOLVEPNP_EPNP method will be used instead.
   -   The minimum number of points is 4 in the general case. In the case of @ref SOLVEPNP_P3P and @ref SOLVEPNP_AP3P
       methods, it is required to use exactly 4 points (the first 3 points are used to estimate all the solutions
       of the P3P problem, the last one is used to retain the best solution that minimizes the reprojection error).
   -   With @ref SOLVEPNP_ITERATIVE method and `useExtrinsicGuess=true`, the minimum number of points is 3 (3 points
       are sufficient to compute a pose but there are up to 4 solutions). The initial solution should be close to the
       global solution to converge.
   -   With @ref SOLVEPNP_IPPE input points must be >= 4 and object points must be coplanar.
   -   With @ref SOLVEPNP_IPPE_SQUARE this is a special case suitable for marker pose estimation.

@param ransacReprojThreshold Parameter used only for RANSAC. It is the maximum distance from a point to an epipolar

The epipolar geometry is described by the following equation:

\f[[p_2; 1]^T F [p_1; 1] = 0\f]

where \f$F\f$ is a fundamental matrix, \f$p_1\f$ and \f$p_2\f$ are corresponding points in the first and the
second images, respectively.

The function calculates the fundamental matrix using one of four methods listed above and returns
the found fundamental matrix. Normally just one matrix is found. But in case of the 7-point
algorithm, the function may return up to 3 solutions ( \f$9 \times 3\f$ matrix that stores all 3
matrices sequentially).

The calculated fundamental matrix may be passed further to #computeCorrespondEpilines that finds the
epipolar lines corresponding to the specified points. It can also be passed to
#stereoRectifyUncalibrated to compute the rectification transformation. :

/** @brief Computes the undistortion and rectification transformation map.

The function computes the joint undistortion and rectification transformation and represents the
result in the form of maps for #remap. The undistorted image looks like original, as if it is
captured with a camera using the camera matrix =newCameraMatrix and zero distortion. In case of a
monocular camera, newCameraMatrix is usually equal to cameraMatrix, or it can be computed by
#getOptimalNewCameraMatrix for a better control over scaling. In case of a stereo camera,
newCameraMatrix is normally set to P1 or P2 computed by #stereoRectify .

Also, this new camera is oriented differently in the coordinate space, according to R. That, for
example, helps to align two heads of a stereo camera so that the epipolar lines on both images
become horizontal and have the same y- coordinate (in case of a horizontally aligned stereo camera).

The function actually builds the maps for the inverse mapping algorithm that is used by #remap. That
is, for each pixel \f$(u, v)\f$ in the destination (corrected and rectified) image, the function
computes the corresponding coordinates in the source image (that is, in the original image from
camera). The following process is applied:
\f[

are the distortion coefficients.

In case of a stereo camera, this function is called twice: once for each camera head, after
#stereoRectify, which in its turn is called after #stereoCalibrate. But if the stereo camera
was not calibrated, it is still possible to compute the rectification transformations directly from
the fundamental matrix using #stereoRectifyUncalibrated. For each camera, the function computes
homography H as the rectification transformation in a pixel domain, not a rotation matrix R in 3D

\f[\texttt{R} = \texttt{cameraMatrix} ^{-1} \cdot \texttt{H} \cdot \texttt{cameraMatrix}\f]

/** @brief Computes the projection and inverse-rectification transformation map. In essense, this is the inverse of
#initUndistortRectifyMap to accomodate stereo-rectification of projectors ('inverse-cameras') in projector-camera pairs.

The function computes the joint projection and inverse rectification transformation and represents the
result in the form of maps for #remap. The projected image looks like a distorted version of the original which,
once projected by a projector, should visually match the original. In case of a monocular camera, newCameraMatrix
is usually equal to cameraMatrix, or it can be computed by
#getOptimalNewCameraMatrix for a better control over scaling. In case of a projector-camera pair,
newCameraMatrix is normally set to P1 or P2 computed by #stereoRectify .

The projector is oriented differently in the coordinate space, according to R. In case of projector-camera pairs,
this helps align the projector (in the same manner as #initUndistortRectifyMap for the camera) to create a stereo-rectified pair. This
allows epipolar lines on both images to become horizontal and have the same y-coordinate (in case of a horizontally aligned projector-camera pair).

computes the corresponding coordinates in the source image (that is, in the original digital image). The following process is applied:

\f[
\begin{array}{l}
\text{newCameraMatrix}\\
x  \leftarrow (u - {c'}_x)/{f'}_x  \\
y  \leftarrow (v - {c'}_y)/{f'}_y  \\

\\\text{Undistortion}
\\\scriptsize{\textit{though equation shown is for radial undistortion, function implements cv::undistortPoints()}}\\
r^2  \leftarrow x^2 + y^2 \\
\theta \leftarrow \frac{1 + k_1 r^2 + k_2 r^4 + k_3 r^6}{1 + k_4 r^2 + k_5 r^4 + k_6 r^6}\\
x' \leftarrow \frac{x}{\theta} \\
y'  \leftarrow \frac{y}{\theta} \\

\\\text{Rectification}\\
{[X\,Y\,W]} ^T  \leftarrow R*[x' \, y' \, 1]^T  \\
x''  \leftarrow X/W  \\
y''  \leftarrow Y/W  \\

\\\text{cameraMatrix}\\
map_x(u,v)  \leftarrow x'' f_x + c_x  \\
map_y(u,v)  \leftarrow y'' f_y + c_y
\end{array}
\f]
where \f$(k_1, k_2, p_1, p_2[, k_3[, k_4, k_5, k_6[, s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4[, \tau_x, \tau_y]]]])\f$
are the distortion coefficients vector distCoeffs.

In case of a stereo-rectified projector-camera pair, this function is called for the projector while #initUndistortRectifyMap is called for the camera head.
This is done after #stereoRectify, which in turn is called after #stereoCalibrate. If the projector-camera pair
is not calibrated, it is still possible to compute the rectification transformations directly from
the fundamental matrix using #stereoRectifyUncalibrated. For the projector and camera, the function computes
homography H as the rectification transformation in a pixel domain, not a rotation matrix R in 3D
space. R can be computed from H as
\f[\texttt{R} = \texttt{cameraMatrix} ^{-1} \cdot \texttt{H} \cdot \texttt{cameraMatrix}\f]
where cameraMatrix can be chosen arbitrarily.

@param cameraMatrix Input camera matrix \f$A=\vecthreethree{f_x}{0}{c_x}{0}{f_y}{c_y}{0}{0}{1}\f$ .

of 4, 5, 8, 12 or 14 elements. If the vector is NULL/empty, the zero distortion coefficients are assumed.
@param R Optional rectification transformation in the object space (3x3 matrix). R1 or R2,
computed by #stereoRectify can be passed here. If the matrix is empty, the identity transformation
is assumed.

/** @brief Returns the default new camera matrix.

The function returns the camera matrix that is either an exact copy of the input cameraMatrix (when
centerPrinicipalPoint=false ), or the modified one (when centerPrincipalPoint=true).

In the latter case, the new camera matrix will be:

\f[\begin{bmatrix} f_x && 0 && ( \texttt{imgSize.width} -1)*0.5  \\ 0 && f_y && ( \texttt{imgSize.height} -1)*0.5  \\ 0 && 0 && 1 \end{bmatrix} ,\f]

where \f$f_x\f$ and \f$f_y\f$ are \f$(0,0)\f$ and \f$(1,1)\f$ elements of cameraMatrix, respectively.

By default, the undistortion functions in OpenCV (see #initUndistortRectifyMap, #undistort) do not
move the principal point. However, when you work with stereo, it is important to move the principal
points in both views to the same y-coordinate (which is required by most of stereo correspondence
algorithms), and may be to the same x-coordinate too. So, you can form the new camera matrix for
each view where the principal points are located at the center.

@param cameraMatrix Input camera matrix.
@param imgsize Camera view image size in pixels.
@param centerPrincipalPoint Location of the principal point in the new camera matrix. The

noticeable radial (or maybe pinclusion) distortion the rectangular image plane is distorted and
turns into some convex or concave shape. The function computes approximate inscribed (inner) and

the newCameraMatrix so that the result image, for example, fits all the data from the original image
(at the expense of possibly big "black" areas) or, for another example, gets rid of black areas at the expense
some lost data near the original image edge. The function #getOptimalNewCameraMatrix uses this function
to compute the optimal new camera matrix.

The function is similar to #undistort and #initUndistortRectifyMap but it operates on a

to  #projectPoints. In case of a 3D object, it does not reconstruct its 3D coordinates, but for a
planar object, it does, up to a translation vector, if the proper R is specified.

For each observed point coordinate \f$(u, v)\f$ the function computes:

/** @brief Octree for 3D vision.
 *
 * In 3D vision filed, the Octree is used to process and accelerate the pointcloud data. The class Octree represents
 * the Octree data structure. Each Octree will have a fixed depth. The depth of Octree refers to the distance from
 * the root node to the leaf node.All OctreeNodes will not exceed this depth.Increasing the depth will increase
 * the amount of calculation exponentially. And the small number of depth refers low resolution of Octree.
 * Each node contains 8 children, which are used to divide the space cube into eight parts. Each octree node represents
 * a cube. And these eight children will have a fixed order, the order is described as follows:
 *
 * For illustration, assume,
 *
 * rootNode: origin == (0, 0, 0), size == 2
 *
 * Then,
 *
 * children[0]: origin == (0, 0, 0), size == 1
 *
 * children[1]: origin == (1, 0, 0), size == 1, along X-axis next to child 0
 *
 * children[2]: origin == (0, 1, 0), size == 1, along Y-axis next to child 0
 *
 * children[3]: origin == (1, 1, 0), size == 1, in X-Y plane
 *
 * children[4]: origin == (0, 0, 1), size == 1, along Z-axis next to child 0
 *
 * children[5]: origin == (1, 0, 1), size == 1, in X-Z plane
 *
 * children[6]: origin == (0, 1, 1), size == 1, in Y-Z plane
 *
 * children[7]: origin == (1, 1, 1), size == 1, furthest from child 0

/** @brief Renders a set of triangles on a depth and color image

Triangles can be drawn white (1.0, 1.0, 1.0), flat-shaded or with a color interpolation between vertices.
In flat-shaded mode the 1st vertex color of each triangle is used to fill the whole triangle.

The world2cam is an inverted camera pose matrix in fact. It transforms vertices from world to
camera coordinate system.

The camera coordinate system emulates the OpenGL's coordinate system having coordinate origin in a screen center,
X axis pointing right, Y axis pointing up and Z axis pointing towards the viewer
except that image is vertically flipped after the render.
This means that all visible objects are placed in z-negative area, or exactly in -zNear > z > -zFar since
zNear and zFar are positive.
For example, at fovY = PI/2 the point (0, 1, -1) will be projected to (width/2, 0) screen point,
(1, 0, -1) to (width/2 + height/2, height/2). Increasing fovY makes projection smaller and vice versa.

The function does not create or clear output images before the rendering. This means that it can be used
for drawing over an existing image or for rendering a model into a 3D scene using pre-filled Z-buffer.

Empty scene results in a depth buffer filled by the maximum value since every pixel is infinitely far from the camera.
Therefore, before rendering anything from scratch the depthBuf should be filled by zFar values (or by ones in INVDEPTH mode).

There are special versions of this function named triangleRasterizeDepth and triangleRasterizeColor
for cases if a user needs a color image or a depth image alone; they may run slightly faster.
