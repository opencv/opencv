defined on an `n`-dimensional Euclidean space, using the **Nelder-Mead method**, also known as
**downhill simplex method**. The basic idea about the method can be obtained from
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelder-Mead_method>.

It should be noted, that this method, although deterministic, is rather a heuristic and therefore
may converge to a local minima, not necessary a global one. It is iterative optimization technique,
which at each step uses an information about the values of a function evaluated only at `n+1`
points, arranged as a *simplex* in `n`-dimensional space (hence the second name of the method). At
each step new point is chosen to evaluate function at, obtained value is compared with previous
ones and based on this information simplex changes it's shape , slowly moving to the local minimum.
Thus this method is using *only* function values to make decision, on contrary to, say, Nonlinear
Conjugate Gradient method (which is also implemented in optim).

Algorithm stops when the number of function evaluations done exceeds termcrit.maxCount, when the
function values at the vertices of simplex are within termcrit.epsilon range or simplex becomes so
small that it can enclosed in a box with termcrit.epsilon sides, whatever comes first, for some
defined by user positive integer termcrit.maxCount and positive non-integer termcrit.epsilon.

@note DownhillSolver is a derivative of the abstract interface
cv::MinProblemSolver, which in turn is derived from the Algorithm interface and is used to
encapsulate the functionality, common to all non-linear optimization algorithms in the optim
module.

    determines the position of a simplex (it will become simplex's centroid), while step determines the
    spread (size in each dimension) of a simplex. To be more precise, if \f$s,x_0\in\mathbb{R}^n\f$ are
    the initial step and initial point respectively, the vertices of a simplex will be:

/** @brief This class is used to perform the non-linear non-constrained minimization of a function
with known gradient,

defined on an *n*-dimensional Euclidean space, using the **Nonlinear Conjugate Gradient method**.
The implementation was done based on the beautifully clear explanatory article [An Introduction to
the Conjugate Gradient Method Without the Agonizing
Pain](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake-papers/painless-conjugate-gradient.pdf) by Jonathan Richard
Shewchuk. The method can be seen as an adaptation of a standard Conjugate Gradient method (see, for
example <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_gradient_method>) for numerically solving the
systems of linear equations.

It should be noted, that this method, although deterministic, is rather a heuristic method and
therefore may converge to a local minima, not necessary a global one. What is even more disastrous,
most of its behaviour is ruled by gradient, therefore it essentially cannot distinguish between
local minima and maxima. Therefore, if it starts sufficiently near to the local maximum, it may
converge to it. Another obvious restriction is that it should be possible to compute the gradient of
a function at any point, thus it is preferable to have analytic expression for gradient and
computational burden should be born by the user.

The latter responsibility is accomplished via the getGradient method of a
MinProblemSolver::Function interface (which represents function being optimized). This method takes
point a point in *n*-dimensional space (first argument represents the array of coordinates of that
point) and compute its gradient (it should be stored in the second argument as an array).

@note class ConjGradSolver thus does not add any new methods to the basic MinProblemSolver interface.

@note term criteria should meet following condition:
@code
    termcrit.type == (TermCriteria::MAX_ITER + TermCriteria::EPS) && termcrit.epsilon > 0 && termcrit.maxCount > 0

/** @brief Solve given (non-integer) linear programming problem using the Simplex Algorithm (Simplex Method).

What we mean here by "linear programming problem" (or LP problem, for short) can be formulated as:

\f[\mbox{Maximize } c\cdot x\\
 \mbox{Subject to:}\\
 Ax\leq b\\
 x\geq 0\f]

Where \f$c\f$ is fixed `1`-by-`n` row-vector, \f$A\f$ is fixed `m`-by-`n` matrix, \f$b\f$ is fixed `m`-by-`1`
column vector and \f$x\f$ is an arbitrary `n`-by-`1` column vector, which satisfies the constraints.

Simplex algorithm is one of many algorithms that are designed to handle this sort of problems
efficiently. Although it is not optimal in theoretical sense (there exist algorithms that can solve
any problem written as above in polynomial time, while simplex method degenerates to exponential
time for some special cases), it is well-studied, easy to implement and is shown to work well for
real-life purposes.

The particular implementation is taken almost verbatim from **Introduction to Algorithms, third
edition** by T. H. Cormen, C. E. Leiserson, R. L. Rivest and Clifford Stein. In particular, the
Bland's rule <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bland%27s_rule> is used to prevent cycling.

@param Func This row-vector corresponds to \f$c\f$ in the LP problem formulation (see above). It should
contain 32- or 64-bit floating point numbers. As a convenience, column-vector may be also submitted,
in the latter case it is understood to correspond to \f$c^T\f$.
@param Constr `m`-by-`n+1` matrix, whose rightmost column corresponds to \f$b\f$ in formulation above
and the remaining to \f$A\f$. It should contain 32- or 64-bit floating point numbers.
@param z The solution will be returned here as a column-vector - it corresponds to \f$c\f$ in the
formulation above. It will contain 64-bit floating point numbers.
@param constr_eps allowed numeric disparity for constraints
@return One of cv::SolveLPResult
