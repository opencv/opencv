@defgroup highgui High-level GUI

While OpenCV was designed for use in full-scale applications and can be used within functionally
rich UI frameworks (such as Qt\*, WinForms\*, or Cocoa\*) or without any UI at all, sometimes there
it is required to try functionality quickly and visualize the results. This is what the HighGUI
module has been designed for.

It provides easy interface to:

-   Create and manipulate windows that can display images and "remember" their content (no need to
    handle repaint events from OS).
-   Add trackbars to the windows, handle simple mouse events as well as keyboard commands.

    ![image](pics/qtgui.png)

    This figure explains new functionality implemented with Qt\* GUI. The new GUI provides a statusbar,
    a toolbar, and a control panel. The control panel can have trackbars and buttonbars attached to it.
    If you cannot see the control panel, press Ctrl+P or right-click any Qt window and select **Display
    properties window**.

    -   To attach a trackbar, the window name parameter must be NULL.

    -   To attach a buttonbar, a button must be created. If the last bar attached to the control panel
        is a buttonbar, the new button is added to the right of the last button. If the last bar
        attached to the control panel is a trackbar, or the control panel is empty, a new buttonbar is
        created. Then, a new button is attached to it.

    See below the example used to generate the figure:

    @include highgui_qt.cpp

    @defgroup highgui_winrt WinRT support

    This figure explains new functionality implemented with WinRT GUI. The new GUI provides an Image control,
    and a slider panel. Slider panel holds trackbars attached to it.

    Sliders are attached below the image control. Every new slider is added below the previous one.

    See below the example used to generate the figure:
    @code
    void sample_app::MainPage::ShowWindow()
    {
        static cv::String windowName("sample");
        cv::winrt_initContainer(this->cvContainer);
        cv::namedWindow(windowName); // not required

        cv::Mat image = cv::imread("Assets/sample.jpg");
        cv::Mat converted = cv::Mat(image.rows, image.cols, CV_8UC4);
        cv::cvtColor(image, converted, COLOR_BGR2BGRA);
        cv::imshow(windowName, converted); // this will create window if it hasn't been created before

        int state = 42;
        cv::TrackbarCallback callback = [](int pos, void* userdata)
        {
            if (pos == 0) {
                cv::destroyWindow(windowName);
            }
        };
        cv::TrackbarCallback callbackTwin = [](int pos, void* userdata)
        {
            if (pos >= 70) {
                cv::destroyAllWindows();
            }

/** @brief Creates a window.

The function namedWindow creates a window that can be used as a placeholder for images and
trackbars. Created windows are referred to by their names.

If a window with the same name already exists, the function does nothing.

You can call cv::destroyWindow or cv::destroyAllWindows to close the window and de-allocate any associated
memory usage. For a simple program, you do not really have to call these functions because all the
resources and windows of the application are closed automatically by the operating system upon exit.

@note Qt backend supports additional flags:
 -   **WINDOW_NORMAL or WINDOW_AUTOSIZE:** WINDOW_NORMAL enables you to resize the
     window, whereas WINDOW_AUTOSIZE adjusts automatically the window size to fit the
     displayed image (see imshow ), and you cannot change the window size manually.
 -   **WINDOW_FREERATIO or WINDOW_KEEPRATIO:** WINDOW_FREERATIO adjusts the image
     with no respect to its ratio, whereas WINDOW_KEEPRATIO keeps the image ratio.
 -   **WINDOW_GUI_NORMAL or WINDOW_GUI_EXPANDED:** WINDOW_GUI_NORMAL is the old way to draw the window
     without statusbar and toolbar, whereas WINDOW_GUI_EXPANDED is a new enhanced GUI.
By default, flags == WINDOW_AUTOSIZE | WINDOW_KEEPRATIO | WINDOW_GUI_EXPANDED

@param winname Name of the window in the window caption that may be used as a window identifier.

The function waitKey waits for a key event infinitely (when \f$\texttt{delay}\leq 0\f$ ) or for delay

running on your computer at that time. It returns the code of the pressed key or -1 if no key was
pressed before the specified time had elapsed. To check for a key press but not wait for it, use
#pollKey.

GUI events, so one of them needs to be called periodically for normal event processing unless
HighGUI is used within an environment that takes care of event processing.

/** @brief Displays an image in the specified window.

The function imshow displays an image in the specified window. If the window was created with the
cv::WINDOW_AUTOSIZE flag, the image is shown with its original size, however it is still limited by the screen resolution.
Otherwise, the image is scaled to fit the window. The function may scale the image, depending on its depth:

-   If the image is 8-bit unsigned, it is displayed as is.
-   If the image is 16-bit unsigned, the pixels are divided by 256. That is, the
    value range [0,255\*256] is mapped to [0,255].
-   If the image is 32-bit or 64-bit floating-point, the pixel values are multiplied by 255. That is, the
    value range [0,1] is mapped to [0,255].
-   32-bit integer images are not processed anymore due to ambiguouty of required transform.
    Convert to 8-bit unsigned matrix using a custom preprocessing specific to image's context.

If window was created with OpenGL support, cv::imshow also support ogl::Buffer , ogl::Texture2D and
cuda::GpuMat as input.

If the window was not created before this function, it is assumed creating a window with cv::WINDOW_AUTOSIZE.

If you need to show an image that is bigger than the screen resolution, you will need to call namedWindow("", WINDOW_NORMAL) before the imshow.

@note This function should be followed by a call to cv::waitKey or cv::pollKey to perform GUI
housekeeping tasks that are necessary to actually show the given image and make the window respond
to mouse and keyboard events. Otherwise, it won't display the image and the window might lock up.
For example, **waitKey(0)** will display the window infinitely until any keypress (it is suitable
for image display). **waitKey(25)** will display a frame and wait approximately 25 ms for a key
press (suitable for displaying a video frame-by-frame). To remove the window, use cv::destroyWindow.

@note [__Windows Backend Only__] Pressing Ctrl+C will copy the image to the clipboard. Pressing Ctrl+S will show a dialog to save the image.
@note [__Wayland Backend Only__] Supoorting format is extended.
-   If the image is 8-bit signed, the pixels are biased by 128. That is, the
    value range [-128,127] is mapped to [0,255].
-   If the image is 16-bit signed, the pixels are divided by 256 and biased by 128. That is, the
    value range [-32768,32767] is mapped to [0,255].
