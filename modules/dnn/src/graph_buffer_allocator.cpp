/* Assigns buffers for all intermediate tensors of the graph/model

 The algorithm is quite simple, but there are some nuances in the attempt to re-use memory more efficiently:

 All layer arguments in graph and sub-graphs are classified into 4 categories:
 a) inputs, b) outputs, c) constants and d) temporary values/tensors.

 Except for the temporary values ("d" category), each other argument gets
 its own dedicated storage, which makes things more clear and predictable.
 So, this algorithm assigns buffers only for the temporary values.

 During the inference process, each temporary value is computed
 by one of the layers and then used by zero or more subsequent layers (only as input).
 An example of a model where some tensors are used more than once is Resnet.
 After a tensor is used for the last time and
 won't be used in any subsequent layer, the memory buffer for that tensor could be re-used for
 other arguments. We want to assign each temporary tensor to some temporary buffer,
 and it's typically N:1 mapping.

 We do it using 2-stage algorithm:

 1. First, we calculate, how many times each argument is used and store the counters into 'usecounts'.
 2. Second, we scan the layers in topologically sorted order
 2.0. Sanity check: We check that each input argument of the operation is either input or constant,
 or it's a temporary tensor with the buffer assigned to it.
 If not, then the layers are not sorted in a topological order.
 2.1. For in-place reshape operations, such as squeeze/unsqueeze/flatten etc.
 or for unary element-wise operations,
 we check whether the input is a temporary value and is not used in any subsequent operations.
 If these checks all pass, we assign output argument to the same buffer as input. Note that
 we don't try to reuse inputs of binary/ternary etc. operation because of the broadcasting.
 We need to do symbolic shape inference to proof that the output is of the same shape as one of the inputs.
 2.2. Otherwise, for each output argument of operation, which is not a network output argument.
 we assign the most recently-used free buffer (i.e. the top buffer in the stack of free buffers).
 If there is no free buffers, i.e. the stack is empty, we create a new buffer, and use it.
 2.3. For each input we decrement the corresponding element of 'usecounts'. If the counter reaches 0 and the input
 is not aliased with one of the outputs (see 2.1),
 we push the corresponding buffer index into the stack of free buffers.
 2.4. In the case of in-place operations and sometimes when using subgraphs (e.g. in If, Loop operations) we may
 re-use the same buffer for several arguments
 (which can be ouputs for some operations and inputs for some subsequent operations).
 In order to handle it all properly, during the buffer assignment algorithm we maintain use counter for each
 buffer, which should not be confused with use counters for arguments. A pool of free buffers contains zero or
 more "spare" buffers with 0 use counts. A buffer in use has the corresponding usage count > 0.
 When some argument is not needed anymore, and if it's not a constant, it decrements the usage counter of the buffer
 where it resides. When the counter reaches zero, we return the buffer into the pool of free buffers and then
 we can reuse the same buffer for another argument (or probably different shape and/or type, see below).
 In principle, we could 'protect' some buffers from the premature release and re-use by incrementing the use counts
 of the respective arguments that reside in those buffers, but that would make the bookkeeping much more complex.

 Please, note that when we reuse buffers, we don't check any types, shape or a total size of the buffer needed.
 We reallocate each buffer at runtime to fit each single argument that it's used for. For example, let's say the buffer #3
 is used for arguments #5 (10x10x10 FP32), #10 (6x6x32 FP32) and #14 (300x1 UINT64). Then during the the first run of
 the inference the buffer #3 will be reallocated from 0 bytes to 1000*4 bytes to fit arg #10,
 then from 4000 to 6*6*32*4=4608 bytes to fit arg #10 and then it will fit arg #14 without reallocations.
 During the second run of inference with the same resolution input the buffer will not be reallocated.

 The reallocation is done using Buffer.fit() function.

    /*
     Here are 3 workhorse methods that abstract the use and bookkeeping of buffers:
     1. getFreeBuffer() takes the first spare buffer from the pool of free buffers. Since
     we don't necessarily know the shape/type of tensor type at this stage, this is quite
     reasonable behaviour - we cannot do anything more complex that that. On the positive side,
     since the pool of free buffers operates like a stack, the first free buffer is the most
     recently released buffer, so we improve cache locality using this pattern.
     When we don't have spare buffers in the pool, we "virtually" create a new buffer
     (by incrementing the number of buffers used) and return it.

     For the retrieved buffer we set its use count to 1.
     2. releaseBuffer(bufidx) decrements the buffer use count and returns it to the pool
     of free buffers as long as the use counter reaches 0.
     3. shareBuffer(from_arg, to_arg) takes two argument indices.
     It makes argument 'to_arg' use the same buffer as 'from_arg'.
     Use counter for the assigned to 'to_arg' buffer (if any) is decremented.
     Use counter for the 'from_arg' buffer is incremented, correpondingly.
