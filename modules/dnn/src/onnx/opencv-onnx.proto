// Overview
//
// ONNX is an open specification that is comprised of the following components:
//
// 1)  A definition of an extensible computation graph model.
// 2)  Definitions of standard data types.
// 3)  Definitions of built-in operators.
//
// This document describes the syntax of models and their computation graphs,
// as well as the standard data types. Together, they are referred to as the ONNX
// Intermediate Representation, or 'IR' for short.
//
// The normative semantic specification of the ONNX IR is found in docs/IR.md.
// Definitions of the built-in neural network operators may be found in docs/Operators.md.

// Notes
//
// Protobuf compatibility
//
// To simplify framework compatibility, ONNX is defined using the subset of protobuf
// that is compatible with both protobuf v2 and v3. This means that we do not use any
// protobuf features that are only available in one of the two versions.
//
// Here are the most notable contortions we have to carry out to work around
// these limitations:
//
//   - No 'map' (added protobuf 3.0). We instead represent mappings as lists
//     of key-value pairs, where order does not matter and duplicates
//     are not allowed.


// Versioning
//
// ONNX versioning is specified in docs/IR.md and elaborated on in docs/Versioning.md
//
// To be compatible with both proto2 and proto3, we will use a version number
// that is not defined by the default value but an explicit enum number.
enum Version {
  // proto3 requires the first enum value to be zero.
  // We add this just to appease the compiler.
  _START_VERSION = 0;
  // The version field is always serialized and we will use it to store the
  // version that the  graph is generated from. This helps us set up version
  // control.
  // For the IR, we are using simple numbers starting with 0x00000001,
  // which was the version we published on Oct 10, 2017.

  //
  // An execution of the training algorithm step is performed by executing the
