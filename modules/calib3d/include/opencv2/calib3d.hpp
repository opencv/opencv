  @defgroup calib3d Camera Calibration and 3D Reconstruction

The functions in this section use a so-called pinhole camera model. The view of a scene
is obtained by projecting a scene's 3D point \f$P_w\f$ into the image plane using a perspective
transformation which forms the corresponding pixel \f$p\f$. Both \f$P_w\f$ and \f$p\f$ are
represented in homogeneous coordinates, i.e. as 3D and 2D homogeneous vector respectively. You will
find a brief introduction to projective geometry, homogeneous vectors and homogeneous
transformations at the end of this section's introduction. For more succinct notation, we often drop
the 'homogeneous' and say vector instead of homogeneous vector.

The distortion-free projective transformation given by a  pinhole camera model is shown below.

\f[s \; p = A \begin{bmatrix} R|t \end{bmatrix} P_w,\f]

where \f$P_w\f$ is a 3D point expressed with respect to the world coordinate system,
\f$p\f$ is a 2D pixel in the image plane, \f$A\f$ is the camera intrinsic matrix,
\f$R\f$ and \f$t\f$ are the rotation and translation that describe the change of coordinates from
world to camera coordinate systems (or camera frame) and \f$s\f$ is the projective transformation's
arbitrary scaling and not part of the camera model.

The camera intrinsic matrix \f$A\f$ (notation used as in @cite Zhang2000 and also generally notated
as \f$K\f$) projects 3D points given in the camera coordinate system to 2D pixel coordinates, i.e.

\f[p = A P_c.\f]

The camera intrinsic matrix \f$A\f$ is composed of the focal lengths \f$f_x\f$ and \f$f_y\f$, which are
expressed in pixel units, and the principal point \f$(c_x, c_y)\f$, that is usually close to the
image center:

\f[A = \vecthreethree{f_x}{0}{c_x}{0}{f_y}{c_y}{0}{0}{1},\f]

and thus

\f[s \vecthree{u}{v}{1} = \vecthreethree{f_x}{0}{c_x}{0}{f_y}{c_y}{0}{0}{1} \vecthree{X_c}{Y_c}{Z_c}.\f]

The matrix of intrinsic parameters does not depend on the scene viewed. So, once estimated, it can
be re-used as long as the focal length is fixed (in case of a zoom lens). Thus, if an image from the
camera is scaled by a factor, all of these parameters need to be scaled (multiplied/divided,
respectively) by the same factor.

The joint rotation-translation matrix \f$[R|t]\f$ is the matrix product of a projective
transformation and a homogeneous transformation. The 3-by-4 projective transformation maps 3D points
represented in camera coordinates to 2D points in the image plane and represented in normalized
camera coordinates \f$x' = X_c / Z_c\f$ and \f$y' = Y_c / Z_c\f$:

\f[Z_c \begin{bmatrix}
x' \\
y' \\
1
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
X_c \\
Y_c \\
Z_c \\
1
\end{bmatrix}.\f]

The homogeneous transformation is encoded by the extrinsic parameters \f$R\f$ and \f$t\f$ and
represents the change of basis from world coordinate system \f$w\f$ to the camera coordinate sytem
\f$c\f$. Thus, given the representation of the point \f$P\f$ in world coordinates, \f$P_w\f$, we
obtain \f$P\f$'s representation in the camera coordinate system, \f$P_c\f$, by

\f[P_c = \begin{bmatrix}
R & t \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix} P_w,\f]

This homogeneous transformation is composed out of \f$R\f$, a 3-by-3 rotation matrix, and \f$t\f$, a
3-by-1 translation vector:

\f[\begin{bmatrix}
R & t \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
r_{11} & r_{12} & r_{13} & t_x \\
r_{21} & r_{22} & r_{23} & t_y \\
r_{31} & r_{32} & r_{33} & t_z \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix},
\f]

and therefore

\f[\begin{bmatrix}
X_c \\
Y_c \\
Z_c \\
1
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
r_{11} & r_{12} & r_{13} & t_x \\
r_{21} & r_{22} & r_{23} & t_y \\
r_{31} & r_{32} & r_{33} & t_z \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
X_w \\
Y_w \\
Z_w \\
1
\end{bmatrix}.\f]

Combining the projective transformation and the homogeneous transformation, we obtain the projective
transformation that maps 3D points in world coordinates into 2D points in the image plane and in
normalized camera coordinates:

\f[Z_c \begin{bmatrix}
x' \\
y' \\
1
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} R|t \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
X_w \\
Y_w \\
Z_w \\
1
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
r_{11} & r_{12} & r_{13} & t_x \\
r_{21} & r_{22} & r_{23} & t_y \\
r_{31} & r_{32} & r_{33} & t_z
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
X_w \\
Y_w \\
Z_w \\
1
\end{bmatrix},\f]

with \f$x' = X_c / Z_c\f$ and \f$y' = Y_c / Z_c\f$. Putting the equations for instrincs and extrinsics together, we can write out
\f$s \; p = A \begin{bmatrix} R|t \end{bmatrix} P_w\f$ as

\f[s \vecthree{u}{v}{1} = \vecthreethree{f_x}{0}{c_x}{0}{f_y}{c_y}{0}{0}{1}
\begin{bmatrix}
r_{11} & r_{12} & r_{13} & t_x \\
r_{21} & r_{22} & r_{23} & t_y \\
r_{31} & r_{32} & r_{33} & t_z
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
X_w \\
Y_w \\
Z_w \\
1
\end{bmatrix}.\f]

If \f$Z_c \ne 0\f$, the transformation above is equivalent to the following,

\f[\begin{bmatrix}
u \\
v
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
f_x X_c/Z_c + c_x \\
f_y Y_c/Z_c + c_y
\end{bmatrix}\f]

with

\f[\vecthree{X_c}{Y_c}{Z_c} = \begin{bmatrix}
R|t
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
X_w \\
Y_w \\
Z_w \\
1
\end{bmatrix}.\f]

The following figure illustrates the pinhole camera model.

![Pinhole camera model](pics/pinhole_camera_model.png)

Real lenses usually have some distortion, mostly radial distortion, and slight tangential distortion.
So, the above model is extended as:

\f[\begin{bmatrix}
u \\
v
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
f_x x'' + c_x \\
f_y y'' + c_y
\end{bmatrix}\f]

where

\f[\begin{bmatrix}
x'' \\
y''
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
x' \frac{1 + k_1 r^2 + k_2 r^4 + k_3 r^6}{1 + k_4 r^2 + k_5 r^4 + k_6 r^6} + 2 p_1 x' y' + p_2(r^2 + 2 x'^2) + s_1 r^2 + s_2 r^4 \\
y' \frac{1 + k_1 r^2 + k_2 r^4 + k_3 r^6}{1 + k_4 r^2 + k_5 r^4 + k_6 r^6} + p_1 (r^2 + 2 y'^2) + 2 p_2 x' y' + s_3 r^2 + s_4 r^4 \\
\end{bmatrix}\f]

with

\f[r^2 = x'^2 + y'^2\f]

and

\f[\begin{bmatrix}
x'\\
y'
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
X_c/Z_c \\
Y_c/Z_c
\end{bmatrix},\f]

if \f$Z_c \ne 0\f$.

The distortion parameters are the radial coefficients \f$k_1\f$, \f$k_2\f$, \f$k_3\f$, \f$k_4\f$, \f$k_5\f$, and \f$k_6\f$
,\f$p_1\f$ and \f$p_2\f$ are the tangential distortion coefficients, and \f$s_1\f$, \f$s_2\f$, \f$s_3\f$, and \f$s_4\f$,
are the thin prism distortion coefficients. Higher-order coefficients are not considered in OpenCV.

The next figures show two common types of radial distortion: barrel distortion
(\f$ 1 + k_1 r^2 + k_2 r^4 + k_3 r^6 \f$ monotonically decreasing)
and pincushion distortion (\f$ 1 + k_1 r^2 + k_2 r^4 + k_3 r^6 \f$ monotonically increasing).
Radial distortion is always monotonic for real lenses,
and if the estimator produces a non-monotonic result,
this should be considered a calibration failure.
More generally, radial distortion must be monotonic and the distortion function must be bijective.
A failed estimation result may look deceptively good near the image center
but will work poorly in e.g. AR/SFM applications.
The optimization method used in OpenCV camera calibration does not include these constraints as
the framework does not support the required integer programming and polynomial inequalities.
See [issue #15992](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/15992) for additional information.

![](pics/distortion_examples.png)
![](pics/distortion_examples2.png)

In some cases, the image sensor may be tilted in order to focus an oblique plane in front of the
camera (Scheimpflug principle). This can be useful for particle image velocimetry (PIV) or
triangulation with a laser fan. The tilt causes a perspective distortion of \f$x''\f$ and
\f$y''\f$. This distortion can be modeled in the following way, see e.g. @cite Louhichi07.

\f[\begin{bmatrix}
u \\
v
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
f_x x''' + c_x \\
f_y y''' + c_y
\end{bmatrix},\f]

where

\f[s\vecthree{x'''}{y'''}{1} =
\vecthreethree{R_{33}(\tau_x, \tau_y)}{0}{-R_{13}(\tau_x, \tau_y)}
{0}{R_{33}(\tau_x, \tau_y)}{-R_{23}(\tau_x, \tau_y)}
{0}{0}{1} R(\tau_x, \tau_y) \vecthree{x''}{y''}{1}\f]

and the matrix \f$R(\tau_x, \tau_y)\f$ is defined by two rotations with angular parameter
\f$\tau_x\f$ and \f$\tau_y\f$, respectively,

\f[
R(\tau_x, \tau_y) =
\vecthreethree{\cos(\tau_y)}{0}{-\sin(\tau_y)}{0}{1}{0}{\sin(\tau_y)}{0}{\cos(\tau_y)}
\vecthreethree{1}{0}{0}{0}{\cos(\tau_x)}{\sin(\tau_x)}{0}{-\sin(\tau_x)}{\cos(\tau_x)} =
\vecthreethree{\cos(\tau_y)}{\sin(\tau_y)\sin(\tau_x)}{-\sin(\tau_y)\cos(\tau_x)}
{0}{\cos(\tau_x)}{\sin(\tau_x)}
{\sin(\tau_y)}{-\cos(\tau_y)\sin(\tau_x)}{\cos(\tau_y)\cos(\tau_x)}.
\f]

In the functions below the coefficients are passed or returned as

\f[(k_1, k_2, p_1, p_2[, k_3[, k_4, k_5, k_6 [, s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4[, \tau_x, \tau_y]]]])\f]

vector. That is, if the vector contains four elements, it means that \f$k_3=0\f$ . The distortion
coefficients do not depend on the scene viewed. Thus, they also belong to the intrinsic camera
parameters. And they remain the same regardless of the captured image resolution. If, for example, a
camera has been calibrated on images of 320 x 240 resolution, absolutely the same distortion
coefficients can be used for 640 x 480 images from the same camera while \f$f_x\f$, \f$f_y\f$,
\f$c_x\f$, and \f$c_y\f$ need to be scaled appropriately.

The functions below use the above model to do the following:

-   Project 3D points to the image plane given intrinsic and extrinsic parameters.
-   Compute extrinsic parameters given intrinsic parameters, a few 3D points, and their
projections.
-   Estimate intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters from several views of a known calibration
pattern (every view is described by several 3D-2D point correspondences).
-   Estimate the relative position and orientation of the stereo camera "heads" and compute the
*rectification* transformation that makes the camera optical axes parallel.

<B> Homogeneous Coordinates </B><br>
Homogeneous Coordinates are a system of coordinates that are used in projective geometry. Their use
allows to represent points at infinity by finite coordinates and simplifies formulas when compared
to the cartesian counterparts, e.g. they have the advantage that affine transformations can be
expressed as linear homogeneous transformation.

One obtains the homogeneous vector \f$P_h\f$ by appending a 1 along an n-dimensional cartesian
vector \f$P\f$ e.g. for a 3D cartesian vector the mapping \f$P \rightarrow P_h\f$ is:

\f[\begin{bmatrix}
X \\
Y \\
Z
\end{bmatrix} \rightarrow \begin{bmatrix}
X \\
Y \\
Z \\
1
\end{bmatrix}.\f]

For the inverse mapping \f$P_h \rightarrow P\f$, one divides all elements of the homogeneous vector
by its last element, e.g. for a 3D homogeneous vector one gets its 2D cartesian counterpart by:

\f[\begin{bmatrix}
X \\
Y \\
W
\end{bmatrix} \rightarrow \begin{bmatrix}
X / W \\
Y / W
\end{bmatrix},\f]

if \f$W \ne 0\f$.

Due to this mapping, all multiples \f$k P_h\f$, for \f$k \ne 0\f$, of a homogeneous point represent
the same point \f$P_h\f$. An intuitive understanding of this property is that under a projective
transformation, all multiples of \f$P_h\f$ are mapped to the same point. This is the physical
observation one does for pinhole cameras, as all points along a ray through the camera's pinhole are
projected to the same image point, e.g. all points along the red ray in the image of the pinhole
camera model above would be mapped to the same image coordinate. This property is also the source
for the scale ambiguity s in the equation of the pinhole camera model.

As mentioned, by using homogeneous coordinates we can express any change of basis parameterized by
\f$R\f$ and \f$t\f$ as a linear transformation, e.g. for the change of basis from coordinate system
0 to coordinate system 1 becomes:

\f[P_1 = R P_0 + t \rightarrow P_{h_1} = \begin{bmatrix}
R & t \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix} P_{h_0}.\f]

@note
    -   Many functions in this module take a camera intrinsic matrix as an input parameter. Although all
        functions assume the same structure of this parameter, they may name it differently. The
        parameter's description, however, will be clear in that a camera intrinsic matrix with the structure
        shown above is required.

Inverse transformation can be also done easily, since

\f[\sin ( \theta ) \vecthreethree{0}{-r_z}{r_y}{r_z}{0}{-r_x}{-r_y}{r_x}{0} = \frac{R - R^T}{2}\f]

A rotation vector is a convenient and most compact representation of a rotation matrix (since any
rotation matrix has just 3 degrees of freedom). The representation is used in the global 3D geometry
optimization procedures like @ref calibrateCamera, @ref stereoCalibrate, or @ref solvePnP .

/** @brief Finds a perspective transformation between two planes.

@param srcPoints Coordinates of the points in the original plane, a matrix of the type CV_32FC2
or vector\<Point2f\> .
@param dstPoints Coordinates of the points in the target plane, a matrix of the type CV_32FC2 or
a vector\<Point2f\> .
@param method Method used to compute a homography matrix. The following methods are possible:
-   **0** - a regular method using all the points, i.e., the least squares method
-   @ref RANSAC - RANSAC-based robust method
-   @ref LMEDS - Least-Median robust method
-   @ref RHO - PROSAC-based robust method
@param ransacReprojThreshold Maximum allowed reprojection error to treat a point pair as an inlier
(used in the RANSAC and RHO methods only). That is, if
\f[\| \texttt{dstPoints} _i -  \texttt{convertPointsHomogeneous} ( \texttt{H} \cdot \texttt{srcPoints} _i) \|_2  >  \texttt{ransacReprojThreshold}\f]
then the point \f$i\f$ is considered as an outlier. If srcPoints and dstPoints are measured in pixels,
it usually makes sense to set this parameter somewhere in the range of 1 to 10.
@param mask Optional output mask set by a robust method ( RANSAC or LMeDS ). Note that the input
mask values are ignored.
@param maxIters The maximum number of RANSAC iterations.
@param confidence Confidence level, between 0 and 1.

The function finds and returns the perspective transformation \f$H\f$ between the source and the
destination planes:

\f[s_i  \vecthree{x'_i}{y'_i}{1} \sim H  \vecthree{x_i}{y_i}{1}\f]

so that the back-projection error

\f[\sum _i \left ( x'_i- \frac{h_{11} x_i + h_{12} y_i + h_{13}}{h_{31} x_i + h_{32} y_i + h_{33}} \right )^2+ \left ( y'_i- \frac{h_{21} x_i + h_{22} y_i + h_{23}}{h_{31} x_i + h_{32} y_i + h_{33}} \right )^2\f]

is minimized. If the parameter method is set to the default value 0, the function uses all the point
pairs to compute an initial homography estimate with a simple least-squares scheme.

However, if not all of the point pairs ( \f$srcPoints_i\f$, \f$dstPoints_i\f$ ) fit the rigid perspective
transformation (that is, there are some outliers), this initial estimate will be poor. In this case,
you can use one of the three robust methods. The methods RANSAC, LMeDS and RHO try many different
random subsets of the corresponding point pairs (of four pairs each, collinear pairs are discarded), estimate the homography matrix
using this subset and a simple least-squares algorithm, and then compute the quality/goodness of the
computed homography (which is the number of inliers for RANSAC or the least median re-projection error for
LMeDS). The best subset is then used to produce the initial estimate of the homography matrix and
the mask of inliers/outliers.

Regardless of the method, robust or not, the computed homography matrix is refined further (using
inliers only in case of a robust method) with the Levenberg-Marquardt method to reduce the
re-projection error even more.

The methods RANSAC and RHO can handle practically any ratio of outliers but need a threshold to
distinguish inliers from outliers. The method LMeDS does not need any threshold but it works
correctly only when there are more than 50% of inliers. Finally, if there are no outliers and the
noise is rather small, use the default method (method=0).

The function is used to find initial intrinsic and extrinsic matrices. Homography matrix is
determined up to a scale. If \f$h_{33}\f$ is non-zero, the matrix is normalized so that \f$h_{33}=1\f$.
@note Whenever an \f$H\f$ matrix cannot be estimated, an empty one will be returned.

- P3P methods (@ref SOLVEPNP_P3P, @ref SOLVEPNP_AP3P): need 4 input points to return a unique solution.
- @ref SOLVEPNP_IPPE Input points must be >= 4 and object points must be coplanar.
- @ref SOLVEPNP_IPPE_SQUARE Special case suitable for marker pose estimation.
Number of input points must be 4. Object points must be defined in the following order:
  - point 0: [-squareLength / 2,  squareLength / 2, 0]
  - point 1: [ squareLength / 2,  squareLength / 2, 0]
  - point 2: [ squareLength / 2, -squareLength / 2, 0]
  - point 3: [-squareLength / 2, -squareLength / 2, 0]

@note
   -   An example of how to use solvePnP for planar augmented reality can be found at
        opencv_source_code/samples/python/plane_ar.py
   -   If you are using Python:
        - Numpy array slices won't work as input because solvePnP requires contiguous
        arrays (enforced by the assertion using cv::Mat::checkVector() around line 55 of
        modules/calib3d/src/solvepnp.cpp version 2.4.9)
        - The P3P algorithm requires image points to be in an array of shape (N,1,2) due
        to its calling of #undistortPoints (around line 75 of modules/calib3d/src/solvepnp.cpp version 2.4.9)
        which requires 2-channel information.
        - Thus, given some data D = np.array(...) where D.shape = (N,M), in order to use a subset of

   -   The methods @ref SOLVEPNP_DLS and @ref SOLVEPNP_UPNP cannot be used as the current implementations are
       unstable and sometimes give completely wrong results. If you pass one of these two
       flags, @ref SOLVEPNP_EPNP method will be used instead.
   -   The minimum number of points is 4 in the general case. In the case of @ref SOLVEPNP_P3P and @ref SOLVEPNP_AP3P
       methods, it is required to use exactly 4 points (the first 3 points are used to estimate all the solutions
       of the P3P problem, the last one is used to retain the best solution that minimizes the reprojection error).
   -   With @ref SOLVEPNP_ITERATIVE method and `useExtrinsicGuess=true`, the minimum number of points is 3 (3 points
       are sufficient to compute a pose but there are up to 4 solutions). The initial solution should be close to the
       global solution to converge.
   -   With @ref SOLVEPNP_IPPE input points must be >= 4 and object points must be coplanar.
   -   With @ref SOLVEPNP_IPPE_SQUARE this is a special case suitable for marker pose estimation.
       Number of input points must be 4. Object points must be defined in the following order:
         - point 0: [-squareLength / 2,  squareLength / 2, 0]
         - point 1: [ squareLength / 2,  squareLength / 2, 0]
         - point 2: [ squareLength / 2, -squareLength / 2, 0]
         - point 3: [-squareLength / 2, -squareLength / 2, 0]
    -  With @ref SOLVEPNP_SQPNP input points must be >= 3

@note
   -   An example of how to use solvePnP for planar augmented reality can be found at
        opencv_source_code/samples/python/plane_ar.py
   -   If you are using Python:
        - Numpy array slices won't work as input because solvePnP requires contiguous
        arrays (enforced by the assertion using cv::Mat::checkVector() around line 55 of
        modules/calib3d/src/solvepnp.cpp version 2.4.9)
        - The P3P algorithm requires image points to be in an array of shape (N,1,2) due
        to its calling of #undistortPoints (around line 75 of modules/calib3d/src/solvepnp.cpp version 2.4.9)
        which requires 2-channel information.
        - Thus, given some data D = np.array(...) where D.shape = (N,M), in order to use a subset of
        it as, e.g., imagePoints, one must effectively copy it into a new array: imagePoints =
        np.ascontiguousarray(D[:,:2]).reshape((N,1,2))
   -   The methods @ref SOLVEPNP_DLS and @ref SOLVEPNP_UPNP cannot be used as the current implementations are
       unstable and sometimes give completely wrong results. If you pass one of these two
       flags, @ref SOLVEPNP_EPNP method will be used instead.
   -   The minimum number of points is 4 in the general case. In the case of @ref SOLVEPNP_P3P and @ref SOLVEPNP_AP3P
       methods, it is required to use exactly 4 points (the first 3 points are used to estimate all the solutions
       of the P3P problem, the last one is used to retain the best solution that minimizes the reprojection error).
   -   With @ref SOLVEPNP_ITERATIVE method and `useExtrinsicGuess=true`, the minimum number of points is 3 (3 points
       are sufficient to compute a pose but there are up to 4 solutions). The initial solution should be close to the
       global solution to converge.
   -   With @ref SOLVEPNP_IPPE input points must be >= 4 and object points must be coplanar.
   -   With @ref SOLVEPNP_IPPE_SQUARE this is a special case suitable for marker pose estimation.

-   @ref CALIB_CB_FAST_CHECK Run a fast check on the image that looks for chessboard corners,
and shortcut the call if none is found. This can drastically speed up the call in the
degenerate condition when no chessboard is observed.
-   @ref CALIB_CB_PLAIN All other flags are ignored. The input image is taken as is.
No image processing is done to improve to find the checkerboard. This has the effect of speeding up the
execution of the function but could lead to not recognizing the checkerboard if the image
is not previously binarized in the appropriate manner.

The function attempts to determine whether the input image is a view of the chessboard pattern and
locate the internal chessboard corners. The function returns a non-zero value if all of the corners
are found and they are placed in a certain order (row by row, left to right in every row).
Otherwise, if the function fails to find all the corners or reorder them, it returns 0. For example,
a regular chessboard has 8 x 8 squares and 7 x 7 internal corners, that is, points where the black
squares touch each other. The detected coordinates are approximate, and to determine their positions
more accurately, the function calls #cornerSubPix. You also may use the function #cornerSubPix with
different parameters if returned coordinates are not accurate enough.

Sample usage of detecting and drawing chessboard corners: :
@code
    Size patternsize(8,6); //interior number of corners
    Mat gray = ....; //source image
    vector<Point2f> corners; //this will be filled by the detected corners

    //CALIB_CB_FAST_CHECK saves a lot of time on images
    //that do not contain any chessboard corners
    bool patternfound = findChessboardCorners(gray, patternsize, corners,
            CALIB_CB_ADAPTIVE_THRESH + CALIB_CB_NORMALIZE_IMAGE
            + CALIB_CB_FAST_CHECK);

    if(patternfound)

        TermCriteria(CV_TERMCRIT_EPS + CV_TERMCRIT_ITER, 30, 0.1));

    drawChessboardCorners(img, patternsize, Mat(corners), patternfound);
@endcode
@note The function requires white space (like a square-thick border, the wider the better) around
the board to make the detection more robust in various environments. Otherwise, if there is no
border and the background is dark, the outer black squares cannot be segmented properly and so the
square grouping and ordering algorithm fails.

-   2 = left-top corner of a white cell
-   3 = left-top corner of a black cell with a white marker dot
-   4 = left-top corner of a white cell with a black marker dot (pattern origin in case of markers otherwise first corner)

The function is analog to #findChessboardCorners but uses a localized radon
transformation approximated by box filters being more robust to all sort of
noise, faster on larger images and is able to directly return the sub-pixel
position of the internal chessboard corners. The Method is based on the paper
@cite duda2018 "Accurate Detection and Localization of Checkerboard Corners for
Calibration" demonstrating that the returned sub-pixel positions are more
accurate than the one returned by cornerSubPix allowing a precise camera
calibration for demanding applications.

In the case, the flags @ref CALIB_CB_LARGER or @ref CALIB_CB_MARKER are given,
the result can be recovered from the optional meta array. Both flags are
helpful to use calibration patterns exceeding the field of view of the camera.
These oversized patterns allow more accurate calibrations as corners can be
utilized, which are as close as possible to the image borders.  For a
consistent coordinate system across all images, the optional marker (see image
below) can be used to move the origin of the board to the location where the
black circle is located.

@note The function requires a white boarder with roughly the same width as one
of the checkerboard fields around the whole board to improve the detection in
various environments. In addition, because of the localized radon
transformation it is beneficial to use round corners for the field corners
which are located on the outside of the board. The following figure illustrates
a sample checkerboard optimized for the detection. However, any other checkerboard
can be used as well.

/** @brief Estimates the sharpness of a detected chessboard.

Image sharpness, as well as brightness, are a critical parameter for accuracte
camera calibration. For accessing these parameters for filtering out
problematic calibraiton images, this method calculates edge profiles by traveling from
black to white chessboard cell centers. Based on this, the number of pixels is
calculated required to transit from black to white. This width of the
transition area is a good indication of how sharp the chessboard is imaged
and should be below ~3.0 pixels.

@param image Gray image used to find chessboard corners
@param patternSize Size of a found chessboard pattern
@param corners Corners found by #findChessboardCornersSB
@param rise_distance Rise distance 0.8 means 10% ... 90% of the final signal strength
@param vertical By default edge responses for horizontal lines are calculated
@param sharpness Optional output array with a sharpness value for calculated edge responses (see description)

The optional sharpness array is of type CV_32FC1 and has for each calculated
profile one row with the following five entries:
* 0 = x coordinate of the underlying edge in the image
* 1 = y coordinate of the underlying edge in the image
* 2 = width of the transition area (sharpness)
* 3 = signal strength in the black cell (min brightness)

The function attempts to determine whether the input image contains a grid of circles. If it is, the
function locates centers of the circles. The function returns a non-zero value if all of the centers
have been found and they have been placed in a certain order (row by row, left to right in every

/** @brief Finds the camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters from several views of a calibration
pattern.

@param objectPoints In the new interface it is a vector of vectors of calibration pattern points in
the calibration pattern coordinate space (e.g. std::vector<std::vector<cv::Vec3f>>). The outer
vector contains as many elements as the number of pattern views. If the same calibration pattern
is shown in each view and it is fully visible, all the vectors will be the same. Although, it is
possible to use partially occluded patterns or even different patterns in different views. Then,
the vectors will be different. Although the points are 3D, they all lie in the calibration pattern's
XY coordinate plane (thus 0 in the Z-coordinate), if the used calibration pattern is a planar rig.
In the old interface all the vectors of object points from different views are concatenated
together.
@param imagePoints In the new interface it is a vector of vectors of the projections of calibration
pattern points (e.g. std::vector<std::vector<cv::Vec2f>>). imagePoints.size() and
objectPoints.size(), and imagePoints[i].size() and objectPoints[i].size() for each i, must be equal,
respectively. In the old interface all the vectors of object points from different views are
concatenated together.
@param imageSize Size of the image used only to initialize the camera intrinsic matrix.
@param cameraMatrix Input/output 3x3 floating-point camera intrinsic matrix
\f$\cameramatrix{A}\f$ . If @ref CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS
and/or @ref CALIB_FIX_ASPECT_RATIO, @ref CALIB_FIX_PRINCIPAL_POINT or @ref CALIB_FIX_FOCAL_LENGTH
are specified, some or all of fx, fy, cx, cy must be initialized before calling the function.
@param distCoeffs Input/output vector of distortion coefficients
\f$\distcoeffs\f$.
@param rvecs Output vector of rotation vectors (@ref Rodrigues ) estimated for each pattern view
(e.g. std::vector<cv::Mat>>). That is, each i-th rotation vector together with the corresponding
i-th translation vector (see the next output parameter description) brings the calibration pattern
from the object coordinate space (in which object points are specified) to the camera coordinate
space. In more technical terms, the tuple of the i-th rotation and translation vector performs
a change of basis from object coordinate space to camera coordinate space. Due to its duality, this
tuple is equivalent to the position of the calibration pattern with respect to the camera coordinate
space.
@param tvecs Output vector of translation vectors estimated for each pattern view, see parameter
describtion above.
@param stdDeviationsIntrinsics Output vector of standard deviations estimated for intrinsic
parameters. Order of deviations values:
\f$(f_x, f_y, c_x, c_y, k_1, k_2, p_1, p_2, k_3, k_4, k_5, k_6 , s_1, s_2, s_3,
 s_4, \tau_x, \tau_y)\f$ If one of parameters is not estimated, it's deviation is equals to zero.
@param stdDeviationsExtrinsics Output vector of standard deviations estimated for extrinsic
parameters. Order of deviations values: \f$(R_0, T_0, \dotsc , R_{M - 1}, T_{M - 1})\f$ where M is
the number of pattern views. \f$R_i, T_i\f$ are concatenated 1x3 vectors.
 @param perViewErrors Output vector of the RMS re-projection error estimated for each pattern view.
@param flags Different flags that may be zero or a combination of the following values:
-   @ref CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS cameraMatrix contains valid initial values of
fx, fy, cx, cy that are optimized further. Otherwise, (cx, cy) is initially set to the image
center ( imageSize is used), and focal distances are computed in a least-squares fashion.
Note, that if intrinsic parameters are known, there is no need to use this function just to
estimate extrinsic parameters. Use @ref solvePnP instead.
-   @ref CALIB_FIX_PRINCIPAL_POINT The principal point is not changed during the global
optimization. It stays at the center or at a different location specified when
 @ref CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS is set too.
-   @ref CALIB_FIX_ASPECT_RATIO The functions consider only fy as a free parameter. The
ratio fx/fy stays the same as in the input cameraMatrix . When
 @ref CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS is not set, the actual input values of fx and fy are
ignored, only their ratio is computed and used further.
-   @ref CALIB_ZERO_TANGENT_DIST Tangential distortion coefficients \f$(p_1, p_2)\f$ are set
to zeros and stay zero.
-   @ref CALIB_FIX_FOCAL_LENGTH The focal length is not changed during the global optimization if
 @ref CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS is set.
-   @ref CALIB_FIX_K1,..., @ref CALIB_FIX_K6 The corresponding radial distortion
coefficient is not changed during the optimization. If @ref CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS is
set, the coefficient from the supplied distCoeffs matrix is used. Otherwise, it is set to 0.
-   @ref CALIB_RATIONAL_MODEL Coefficients k4, k5, and k6 are enabled. To provide the
backward compatibility, this extra flag should be explicitly specified to make the
calibration function use the rational model and return 8 coefficients or more.
-   @ref CALIB_THIN_PRISM_MODEL Coefficients s1, s2, s3 and s4 are enabled. To provide the
backward compatibility, this extra flag should be explicitly specified to make the
calibration function use the thin prism model and return 12 coefficients or more.
-   @ref CALIB_FIX_S1_S2_S3_S4 The thin prism distortion coefficients are not changed during
the optimization. If @ref CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS is set, the coefficient from the
supplied distCoeffs matrix is used. Otherwise, it is set to 0.
-   @ref CALIB_TILTED_MODEL Coefficients tauX and tauY are enabled. To provide the
backward compatibility, this extra flag should be explicitly specified to make the
calibration function use the tilted sensor model and return 14 coefficients.
-   @ref CALIB_FIX_TAUX_TAUY The coefficients of the tilted sensor model are not changed during
the optimization. If @ref CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS is set, the coefficient from the
supplied distCoeffs matrix is used. Otherwise, it is set to 0.
@param criteria Termination criteria for the iterative optimization algorithm.

@return the overall RMS re-projection error.

The function estimates the intrinsic camera parameters and extrinsic parameters for each of the
views. The algorithm is based on @cite Zhang2000 and @cite BouguetMCT . The coordinates of 3D object
points and their corresponding 2D projections in each view must be specified. That may be achieved
by using an object with known geometry and easily detectable feature points. Such an object is
called a calibration rig or calibration pattern, and OpenCV has built-in support for a chessboard as
a calibration rig (see @ref findChessboardCorners). Currently, initialization of intrinsic
parameters (when @ref CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS is not set) is only implemented for planar calibration
patterns (where Z-coordinates of the object points must be all zeros). 3D calibration rigs can also
be used as long as initial cameraMatrix is provided.

The algorithm performs the following steps:

-   Compute the initial intrinsic parameters (the option only available for planar calibration
    patterns) or read them from the input parameters. The distortion coefficients are all set to
    zeros initially unless some of CALIB_FIX_K? are specified.

-   Estimate the initial camera pose as if the intrinsic parameters have been already known. This is
    done using @ref solvePnP .

-   Run the global Levenberg-Marquardt optimization algorithm to minimize the reprojection error,
    that is, the total sum of squared distances between the observed feature points imagePoints and
    the projected (using the current estimates for camera parameters and the poses) object points
    objectPoints. See @ref projectPoints for details.

@note
    If you use a non-square (i.e. non-N-by-N) grid and @ref findChessboardCorners for calibration,
    and @ref calibrateCamera returns bad values (zero distortion coefficients, \f$c_x\f$ and
    \f$c_y\f$ very far from the image center, and/or large differences between \f$f_x\f$ and
    \f$f_y\f$ (ratios of 10:1 or more)), then you are probably using patternSize=cvSize(rows,cols)
    instead of using patternSize=cvSize(cols,rows) in @ref findChessboardCorners.

@note
    The function may throw exceptions, if unsupported combination of parameters is provided or
    the system is underconstrained.

/** @brief Finds the camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters from several views of a calibration pattern.

This function is an extension of #calibrateCamera with the method of releasing object which was
proposed in @cite strobl2011iccv. In many common cases with inaccurate, unmeasured, roughly planar
targets (calibration plates), this method can dramatically improve the precision of the estimated
camera parameters. Both the object-releasing method and standard method are supported by this
function. Use the parameter **iFixedPoint** for method selection. In the internal implementation,
#calibrateCamera is a wrapper for this function.

@param objectPoints Vector of vectors of calibration pattern points in the calibration pattern
coordinate space. See #calibrateCamera for details. If the method of releasing object to be used,
the identical calibration board must be used in each view and it must be fully visible, and all
objectPoints[i] must be the same and all points should be roughly close to a plane. **The calibration
target has to be rigid, or at least static if the camera (rather than the calibration target) is
shifted for grabbing images.**
@param imagePoints Vector of vectors of the projections of calibration pattern points. See
#calibrateCamera for details.
@param imageSize Size of the image used only to initialize the intrinsic camera matrix.
@param iFixedPoint The index of the 3D object point in objectPoints[0] to be fixed. It also acts as
a switch for calibration method selection. If object-releasing method to be used, pass in the
parameter in the range of [1, objectPoints[0].size()-2], otherwise a value out of this range will
make standard calibration method selected. Usually the top-right corner point of the calibration
board grid is recommended to be fixed when object-releasing method being utilized. According to
\cite strobl2011iccv, two other points are also fixed. In this implementation, objectPoints[0].front
and objectPoints[0].back.z are used. With object-releasing method, accurate rvecs, tvecs and
newObjPoints are only possible if coordinates of these three fixed points are accurate enough.
@param cameraMatrix Output 3x3 floating-point camera matrix. See #calibrateCamera for details.
@param distCoeffs Output vector of distortion coefficients. See #calibrateCamera for details.
@param rvecs Output vector of rotation vectors estimated for each pattern view. See #calibrateCamera
for details.
@param tvecs Output vector of translation vectors estimated for each pattern view.
@param newObjPoints The updated output vector of calibration pattern points. The coordinates might
be scaled based on three fixed points. The returned coordinates are accurate only if the above
mentioned three fixed points are accurate. If not needed, noArray() can be passed in. This parameter
is ignored with standard calibration method.
@param stdDeviationsIntrinsics Output vector of standard deviations estimated for intrinsic parameters.
See #calibrateCamera for details.
@param stdDeviationsExtrinsics Output vector of standard deviations estimated for extrinsic parameters.
See #calibrateCamera for details.
@param stdDeviationsObjPoints Output vector of standard deviations estimated for refined coordinates
of calibration pattern points. It has the same size and order as objectPoints[0] vector. This
parameter is ignored with standard calibration method.
 @param perViewErrors Output vector of the RMS re-projection error estimated for each pattern view.
@param flags Different flags that may be zero or a combination of some predefined values. See
#calibrateCamera for details. If the method of releasing object is used, the calibration time may
be much longer. CALIB_USE_QR or CALIB_USE_LU could be used for faster calibration with potentially
less precise and less stable in some rare cases.
@param criteria Termination criteria for the iterative optimization algorithm.

@param T Output translation vector, see description above.
@param E Output essential matrix.
@param F Output fundamental matrix.
@param rvecs Output vector of rotation vectors ( @ref Rodrigues ) estimated for each pattern view in the
coordinate system of the first camera of the stereo pair (e.g. std::vector<cv::Mat>). More in detail, each
i-th rotation vector together with the corresponding i-th translation vector (see the next output parameter
description) brings the calibration pattern from the object coordinate space (in which object points are
specified) to the camera coordinate space of the first camera of the stereo pair. In more technical terms,
the tuple of the i-th rotation and translation vector performs a change of basis from object coordinate space
to camera coordinate space of the first camera of the stereo pair.
@param tvecs Output vector of translation vectors estimated for each pattern view, see parameter description
of previous output parameter ( rvecs ).
@param perViewErrors Output vector of the RMS re-projection error estimated for each pattern view.
@param flags Different flags that may be zero or a combination of the following values:
-   @ref CALIB_FIX_INTRINSIC Fix cameraMatrix? and distCoeffs? so that only R, T, E, and F
matrices are estimated.
-   @ref CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS Optimize some or all of the intrinsic parameters
according to the specified flags. Initial values are provided by the user.
-   @ref CALIB_USE_EXTRINSIC_GUESS R and T contain valid initial values that are optimized further.
Otherwise R and T are initialized to the median value of the pattern views (each dimension separately).
-   @ref CALIB_FIX_PRINCIPAL_POINT Fix the principal points during the optimization.
-   @ref CALIB_FIX_FOCAL_LENGTH Fix \f$f^{(j)}_x\f$ and \f$f^{(j)}_y\f$ .
-   @ref CALIB_FIX_ASPECT_RATIO Optimize \f$f^{(j)}_y\f$ . Fix the ratio \f$f^{(j)}_x/f^{(j)}_y\f$
.
-   @ref CALIB_SAME_FOCAL_LENGTH Enforce \f$f^{(0)}_x=f^{(1)}_x\f$ and \f$f^{(0)}_y=f^{(1)}_y\f$ .
-   @ref CALIB_ZERO_TANGENT_DIST Set tangential distortion coefficients for each camera to
zeros and fix there.
-   @ref CALIB_FIX_K1,..., @ref CALIB_FIX_K6 Do not change the corresponding radial
distortion coefficient during the optimization. If @ref CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS is set,
the coefficient from the supplied distCoeffs matrix is used. Otherwise, it is set to 0.
-   @ref CALIB_RATIONAL_MODEL Enable coefficients k4, k5, and k6. To provide the backward
compatibility, this extra flag should be explicitly specified to make the calibration
function use the rational model and return 8 coefficients. If the flag is not set, the
function computes and returns only 5 distortion coefficients.
-   @ref CALIB_THIN_PRISM_MODEL Coefficients s1, s2, s3 and s4 are enabled. To provide the
backward compatibility, this extra flag should be explicitly specified to make the
calibration function use the thin prism model and return 12 coefficients. If the flag is not
set, the function computes and returns only 5 distortion coefficients.
-   @ref CALIB_FIX_S1_S2_S3_S4 The thin prism distortion coefficients are not changed during
the optimization. If @ref CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS is set, the coefficient from the
supplied distCoeffs matrix is used. Otherwise, it is set to 0.
-   @ref CALIB_TILTED_MODEL Coefficients tauX and tauY are enabled. To provide the
backward compatibility, this extra flag should be explicitly specified to make the
calibration function use the tilted sensor model and return 14 coefficients. If the flag is not
set, the function computes and returns only 5 distortion coefficients.
-   @ref CALIB_FIX_TAUX_TAUY The coefficients of the tilted sensor model are not changed during
the optimization. If @ref CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS is set, the coefficient from the
supplied distCoeffs matrix is used. Otherwise, it is set to 0.
@param criteria Termination criteria for the iterative optimization algorithm.

The function estimates the transformation between two cameras making a stereo pair. If one computes
the poses of an object relative to the first camera and to the second camera,
( \f$R_1\f$,\f$T_1\f$ ) and (\f$R_2\f$,\f$T_2\f$), respectively, for a stereo camera where the
relative position and orientation between the two cameras are fixed, then those poses definitely
relate to each other. This means, if the relative position and orientation (\f$R\f$,\f$T\f$) of the
two cameras is known, it is possible to compute (\f$R_2\f$,\f$T_2\f$) when (\f$R_1\f$,\f$T_1\f$) is
given. This is what the described function does. It computes (\f$R\f$,\f$T\f$) such that:

\f[R_2=R R_1\f]
\f[T_2=R T_1 + T.\f]

Therefore, one can compute the coordinate representation of a 3D point for the second camera's
coordinate system when given the point's coordinate representation in the first camera's coordinate
system:

\f[\begin{bmatrix}
X_2 \\
Y_2 \\
Z_2 \\
1
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
R & T \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
X_1 \\
Y_1 \\
Z_1 \\
1
\end{bmatrix}.\f]


Optionally, it computes the essential matrix E:

\f[E= \vecthreethree{0}{-T_2}{T_1}{T_2}{0}{-T_0}{-T_1}{T_0}{0} R\f]

where \f$T_i\f$ are components of the translation vector \f$T\f$ : \f$T=[T_0, T_1, T_2]^T\f$ .
And the function can also compute the fundamental matrix F:

\f[F = cameraMatrix2^{-T}\cdot E \cdot cameraMatrix1^{-1}\f]

Besides the stereo-related information, the function can also perform a full calibration of each of
the two cameras. However, due to the high dimensionality of the parameter space and noise in the
input data, the function can diverge from the correct solution. If the intrinsic parameters can be
estimated with high accuracy for each of the cameras individually (for example, using
#calibrateCamera ), you are recommended to do so and then pass @ref CALIB_FIX_INTRINSIC flag to the
function along with the computed intrinsic parameters. Otherwise, if all the parameters are
estimated at once, it makes sense to restrict some parameters, for example, pass
 @ref CALIB_SAME_FOCAL_LENGTH and @ref CALIB_ZERO_TANGENT_DIST flags, which is usually a
reasonable assumption.

Similarly to #calibrateCamera, the function minimizes the total re-projection error for all the
points in all the available views from both cameras. The function returns the final value of the
re-projection error.

/** @brief Computes rectification transforms for each head of a calibrated stereo camera.

@param cameraMatrix1 First camera intrinsic matrix.
@param distCoeffs1 First camera distortion parameters.
@param cameraMatrix2 Second camera intrinsic matrix.
@param distCoeffs2 Second camera distortion parameters.
@param imageSize Size of the image used for stereo calibration.
@param R Rotation matrix from the coordinate system of the first camera to the second camera,
see @ref stereoCalibrate.
@param T Translation vector from the coordinate system of the first camera to the second camera,
see @ref stereoCalibrate.
@param R1 Output 3x3 rectification transform (rotation matrix) for the first camera. This matrix
brings points given in the unrectified first camera's coordinate system to points in the rectified
first camera's coordinate system. In more technical terms, it performs a change of basis from the
unrectified first camera's coordinate system to the rectified first camera's coordinate system.
@param R2 Output 3x3 rectification transform (rotation matrix) for the second camera. This matrix
brings points given in the unrectified second camera's coordinate system to points in the rectified
second camera's coordinate system. In more technical terms, it performs a change of basis from the
unrectified second camera's coordinate system to the rectified second camera's coordinate system.
@param P1 Output 3x4 projection matrix in the new (rectified) coordinate systems for the first
camera, i.e. it projects points given in the rectified first camera coordinate system into the
rectified first camera's image.
@param P2 Output 3x4 projection matrix in the new (rectified) coordinate systems for the second
camera, i.e. it projects points given in the rectified first camera coordinate system into the
rectified second camera's image.
@param Q Output \f$4 \times 4\f$ disparity-to-depth mapping matrix (see @ref reprojectImageTo3D).
@param flags Operation flags that may be zero or @ref CALIB_ZERO_DISPARITY . If the flag is set,
the function makes the principal points of each camera have the same pixel coordinates in the
rectified views. And if the flag is not set, the function may still shift the images in the
horizontal or vertical direction (depending on the orientation of epipolar lines) to maximize the
useful image area.
@param alpha Free scaling parameter. If it is -1 or absent, the function performs the default
scaling. Otherwise, the parameter should be between 0 and 1. alpha=0 means that the rectified
images are zoomed and shifted so that only valid pixels are visible (no black areas after
rectification). alpha=1 means that the rectified image is decimated and shifted so that all the
pixels from the original images from the cameras are retained in the rectified images (no source
image pixels are lost). Any intermediate value yields an intermediate result between
those two extreme cases.
@param newImageSize New image resolution after rectification. The same size should be passed to
#initUndistortRectifyMap (see the stereo_calib.cpp sample in OpenCV samples directory). When (0,0)
is passed (default), it is set to the original imageSize . Setting it to a larger value can help you
preserve details in the original image, especially when there is a big radial distortion.
@param validPixROI1 Optional output rectangles inside the rectified images where all the pixels
are valid. If alpha=0 , the ROIs cover the whole images. Otherwise, they are likely to be smaller
(see the picture below).
@param validPixROI2 Optional output rectangles inside the rectified images where all the pixels
are valid. If alpha=0 , the ROIs cover the whole images. Otherwise, they are likely to be smaller
(see the picture below).

The function computes the rotation matrices for each camera that (virtually) make both camera image
planes the same plane. Consequently, this makes all the epipolar lines parallel and thus simplifies
the dense stereo correspondence problem. The function takes the matrices computed by #stereoCalibrate
as input. As output, it provides two rotation matrices and also two projection matrices in the new
coordinates. The function distinguishes the following two cases:

-   **Horizontal stereo**: the first and the second camera views are shifted relative to each other
    mainly along the x-axis (with possible small vertical shift). In the rectified images, the
    corresponding epipolar lines in the left and right cameras are horizontal and have the same
    y-coordinate. P1 and P2 look like:

    \f[\texttt{P1} = \begin{bmatrix}
                        f & 0 & cx_1 & 0 \\
                        0 & f & cy & 0 \\
                        0 & 0 & 1 & 0
                     \end{bmatrix}\f]

    \f[\texttt{P2} = \begin{bmatrix}
                        f & 0 & cx_2 & T_x \cdot f \\
                        0 & f & cy & 0 \\
                        0 & 0 & 1 & 0
                     \end{bmatrix} ,\f]

    \f[\texttt{Q} = \begin{bmatrix}
                        1 & 0 & 0 & -cx_1 \\
                        0 & 1 & 0 & -cy \\
                        0 & 0 & 0 & f \\
                        0 & 0 & -\frac{1}{T_x} & \frac{cx_1 - cx_2}{T_x}
                    \end{bmatrix} \f]

    where \f$T_x\f$ is a horizontal shift between the cameras and \f$cx_1=cx_2\f$ if
    @ref CALIB_ZERO_DISPARITY is set.

-   **Vertical stereo**: the first and the second camera views are shifted relative to each other
    mainly in the vertical direction (and probably a bit in the horizontal direction too). The epipolar
    lines in the rectified images are vertical and have the same x-coordinate. P1 and P2 look like:

    \f[\texttt{P1} = \begin{bmatrix}
                        f & 0 & cx & 0 \\
                        0 & f & cy_1 & 0 \\
                        0 & 0 & 1 & 0
                     \end{bmatrix}\f]

    \f[\texttt{P2} = \begin{bmatrix}
                        f & 0 & cx & 0 \\
                        0 & f & cy_2 & T_y \cdot f \\
                        0 & 0 & 1 & 0
                     \end{bmatrix},\f]

    \f[\texttt{Q} = \begin{bmatrix}
                        1 & 0 & 0 & -cx \\
                        0 & 1 & 0 & -cy_1 \\
                        0 & 0 & 0 & f \\
                        0 & 0 & -\frac{1}{T_y} & \frac{cy_1 - cy_2}{T_y}
                    \end{bmatrix} \f]

    where \f$T_y\f$ is a vertical shift between the cameras and \f$cy_1=cy_2\f$ if
    @ref CALIB_ZERO_DISPARITY is set.

As you can see, the first three columns of P1 and P2 will effectively be the new "rectified" camera
matrices. The matrices, together with R1 and R2 , can then be passed to #initUndistortRectifyMap to
initialize the rectification map for each camera.

See below the screenshot from the stereo_calib.cpp sample. Some red horizontal lines pass through
the corresponding image regions. This means that the images are well rectified, which is what most
stereo correspondence algorithms rely on. The green rectangles are roi1 and roi2 . You see that
their interiors are all valid pixels.

are rejected prior to computing the homographies. Otherwise, all the points are considered inliers.

The function computes the rectification transformations without knowing intrinsic parameters of the
cameras and their relative position in the space, which explains the suffix "uncalibrated". Another
related difference from #stereoRectify is that the function outputs not the rectification
transformations in the object (3D) space, but the planar perspective transformations encoded by the
homography matrices H1 and H2 . The function implements the algorithm @cite Hartley99 .

@note
   While the algorithm does not need to know the intrinsic parameters of the cameras, it heavily
    depends on the epipolar geometry. Therefore, if the camera lenses have a significant distortion,
    it would be better to correct it before computing the fundamental matrix and calling this
    function. For example, distortion coefficients can be estimated for each head of stereo camera
    separately by using #calibrateCamera . Then, the images can be corrected using #undistort , or
    just the point coordinates can be corrected with #undistortPoints .

The function performs the Hand-Eye calibration using various methods. One approach consists in estimating the
rotation then the translation (separable solutions) and the following methods are implemented:
  - R. Tsai, R. Lenz A New Technique for Fully Autonomous and Efficient 3D Robotics Hand/EyeCalibration \cite Tsai89
  - F. Park, B. Martin Robot Sensor Calibration: Solving AX = XB on the Euclidean Group \cite Park94
  - R. Horaud, F. Dornaika Hand-Eye Calibration \cite Horaud95

Another approach consists in estimating simultaneously the rotation and the translation (simultaneous solutions),
with the following implemented methods:
  - N. Andreff, R. Horaud, B. Espiau On-line Hand-Eye Calibration \cite Andreff99
  - K. Daniilidis Hand-Eye Calibration Using Dual Quaternions \cite Daniilidis98

The following picture describes the Hand-Eye calibration problem where the transformation between a camera ("eye")
mounted on a robot gripper ("hand") has to be estimated. This configuration is called eye-in-hand.

The eye-to-hand configuration consists in a static camera observing a calibration pattern mounted on the robot
end-effector. The transformation from the camera to the robot base frame can then be estimated by inputting
the suitable transformations to the function, see below.

![](pics/hand-eye_figure.png)

The calibration procedure is the following:
  - a static calibration pattern is used to estimate the transformation between the target frame
  and the camera frame
  - the robot gripper is moved in order to acquire several poses
  - for each pose, the homogeneous transformation between the gripper frame and the robot base frame is recorded using for
  instance the robot kinematics
\f[
    \begin{bmatrix}
    X_b\\
    Y_b\\
    Z_b\\
    1
    \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \begin{bmatrix}
    _{}^{b}\textrm{R}_g & _{}^{b}\textrm{t}_g \\
    0_{1 \times 3} & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    X_g\\
    Y_g\\
    Z_g\\
    1
    \end{bmatrix}
\f]
  - for each pose, the homogeneous transformation between the calibration target frame and the camera frame is recorded using
  for instance a pose estimation method (PnP) from 2D-3D point correspondences
\f[
    \begin{bmatrix}
    X_c\\
    Y_c\\
    Z_c\\

    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    X_t\\
    Y_t\\
    Z_t\\
    1
    \end{bmatrix}
\f]

The Hand-Eye calibration procedure returns the following homogeneous transformation
\f[
    \begin{bmatrix}
    X_g\\
    Y_g\\
    Z_g\\
    1
    \end{bmatrix}

    \begin{bmatrix}
    X_c\\
    Y_c\\
    Z_c\\

Additional information can be found on this [website](http://campar.in.tum.de/Chair/HandEyeCalibration).
\note
A minimum of 2 motions with non parallel rotation axes are necessary to determine the hand-eye transformation.
So at least 3 different poses are required, but it is strongly recommended to use many more poses.

This function decomposes the essential matrix E using svd decomposition @cite HartleyZ00. In
general, four possible poses exist for the decomposition of E. They are \f$[R_1, t]\f$,
\f$[R_1, -t]\f$, \f$[R_2, t]\f$, \f$[R_2, -t]\f$.

If E gives the epipolar constraint \f$[p_2; 1]^T A^{-T} E A^{-1} [p_1; 1] = 0\f$ between the image
points \f$p_1\f$ in the first image and \f$p_2\f$ in second image, then any of the tuples
\f$[R_1, t]\f$, \f$[R_1, -t]\f$, \f$[R_2, t]\f$, \f$[R_2, -t]\f$ is a change of basis from the first
camera's coordinate system to the second camera's coordinate system. However, by decomposing E, one
can only get the direction of the translation. For this reason, the translation t is returned with
unit length.

This function extracts relative camera motion between two views of a planar object and returns up to

the homography matrix H is described in detail in @cite Malis2007.

If the homography H, induced by the plane, gives the constraint
\f[s_i \vecthree{x'_i}{y'_i}{1} \sim H \vecthree{x_i}{y_i}{1}\f] on the source image points
\f$p_i\f$ and the destination image points \f$p'_i\f$, then the tuple of rotations[k] and
translations[k] is a change of basis from the source camera's coordinate system to the destination
camera's coordinate system. However, by decomposing H, one can only get the translation normalized
by the (typically unknown) depth of the scene, i.e. its direction but with normalized length.

If point correspondences are available, at least two solutions may further be invalidated, by
applying positive depth constraint, i.e. all points must be in front of the camera.

    computes x-derivative at each pixel and clips its value by [-preFilterCap, preFilterCap] interval.
    The result values are passed to the Birchfield-Tomasi pixel cost function.
    @param uniquenessRatio Margin in percentage by which the best (minimum) computed cost function
    value should "win" the second best value to consider the found match correct. Normally, a value
    within the 5-15 range is good enough.
    @param speckleWindowSize Maximum size of smooth disparity regions to consider their noise speckles
    and invalidate. Set it to 0 to disable speckle filtering. Otherwise, set it somewhere in the
    50-200 range.
    @param speckleRange Maximum disparity variation within each connected component. If you do speckle
    filtering, set the parameter to a positive value, it will be implicitly multiplied by 16.

/** @brief Computes the undistortion and rectification transformation map.

The function computes the joint undistortion and rectification transformation and represents the
result in the form of maps for #remap. The undistorted image looks like original, as if it is
captured with a camera using the camera matrix =newCameraMatrix and zero distortion. In case of a
monocular camera, newCameraMatrix is usually equal to cameraMatrix, or it can be computed by
#getOptimalNewCameraMatrix for a better control over scaling. In case of a stereo camera,
newCameraMatrix is normally set to P1 or P2 computed by #stereoRectify .

Also, this new camera is oriented differently in the coordinate space, according to R. That, for
example, helps to align two heads of a stereo camera so that the epipolar lines on both images
become horizontal and have the same y- coordinate (in case of a horizontally aligned stereo camera).

The function actually builds the maps for the inverse mapping algorithm that is used by #remap. That
is, for each pixel \f$(u, v)\f$ in the destination (corrected and rectified) image, the function
computes the corresponding coordinates in the source image (that is, in the original image from
camera). The following process is applied:
\f[
\begin{array}{l}
x  \leftarrow (u - {c'}_x)/{f'}_x  \\
y  \leftarrow (v - {c'}_y)/{f'}_y  \\

are the distortion coefficients.

In case of a stereo camera, this function is called twice: once for each camera head, after
#stereoRectify, which in its turn is called after #stereoCalibrate. But if the stereo camera
was not calibrated, it is still possible to compute the rectification transformations directly from
the fundamental matrix using #stereoRectifyUncalibrated. For each camera, the function computes
homography H as the rectification transformation in a pixel domain, not a rotation matrix R in 3D
space. R can be computed from H as
\f[\texttt{R} = \texttt{cameraMatrix} ^{-1} \cdot \texttt{H} \cdot \texttt{cameraMatrix}\f]

/** @brief Computes the projection and inverse-rectification transformation map. In essense, this is the inverse of
#initUndistortRectifyMap to accomodate stereo-rectification of projectors ('inverse-cameras') in projector-camera pairs.

The function computes the joint projection and inverse rectification transformation and represents the
result in the form of maps for #remap. The projected image looks like a distorted version of the original which,
once projected by a projector, should visually match the original. In case of a monocular camera, newCameraMatrix
is usually equal to cameraMatrix, or it can be computed by
#getOptimalNewCameraMatrix for a better control over scaling. In case of a projector-camera pair,
newCameraMatrix is normally set to P1 or P2 computed by #stereoRectify .

The projector is oriented differently in the coordinate space, according to R. In case of projector-camera pairs,
this helps align the projector (in the same manner as #initUndistortRectifyMap for the camera) to create a stereo-rectified pair. This
allows epipolar lines on both images to become horizontal and have the same y-coordinate (in case of a horizontally aligned projector-camera pair).

The function builds the maps for the inverse mapping algorithm that is used by #remap. That
is, for each pixel \f$(u, v)\f$ in the destination (projected and inverse-rectified) image, the function
computes the corresponding coordinates in the source image (that is, in the original digital image). The following process is applied:

In case of a stereo-rectified projector-camera pair, this function is called for the projector while #initUndistortRectifyMap is called for the camera head.

/** @brief Returns the default new camera matrix.

The function returns the camera matrix that is either an exact copy of the input cameraMatrix (when
centerPrinicipalPoint=false ), or the modified one (when centerPrincipalPoint=true).

In the latter case, the new camera matrix will be:

\f[\begin{bmatrix} f_x && 0 && ( \texttt{imgSize.width} -1)*0.5  \\ 0 && f_y && ( \texttt{imgSize.height} -1)*0.5  \\ 0 && 0 && 1 \end{bmatrix} ,\f]

where \f$f_x\f$ and \f$f_y\f$ are \f$(0,0)\f$ and \f$(1,1)\f$ elements of cameraMatrix, respectively.

By default, the undistortion functions in OpenCV (see #initUndistortRectifyMap, #undistort) do not
move the principal point. However, when you work with stereo, it is important to move the principal
points in both views to the same y-coordinate (which is required by most of stereo correspondence
algorithms), and may be to the same x-coordinate too. So, you can form the new camera matrix for
each view where the principal points are located at the center.

@param cameraMatrix Input camera matrix.
@param imgsize Camera view image size in pixels.
@param centerPrincipalPoint Location of the principal point in the new camera matrix. The
parameter indicates whether this location should be at the image center or not.

/** @brief Computes the ideal point coordinates from the observed point coordinates.

The function is similar to #undistort and #initUndistortRectifyMap but it operates on a
sparse set of points instead of a raster image. Also the function performs a reverse transformation
to  #projectPoints. In case of a 3D object, it does not reconstruct its 3D coordinates, but for a
planar object, it does, up to a translation vector, if the proper R is specified.

For each observed point coordinate \f$(u, v)\f$ the function computes:
\f[
\begin{array}{l}
x^{"}  \leftarrow (u - c_x)/f_x  \\
y^{"}  \leftarrow (v - c_y)/f_y  \\
(x',y') = undistort(x^{"},y^{"}, \texttt{distCoeffs}) \\

\end{array}
\f]

where *undistort* is an approximate iterative algorithm that estimates the normalized original
point coordinates out of the normalized distorted point coordinates ("normalized" means that the
coordinates do not depend on the camera matrix).

The function can be used for both a stereo camera head or a monocular camera (when R is empty).

transformation. If matrix P is identity or omitted, dst will contain normalized point coordinates.
