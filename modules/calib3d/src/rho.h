/**
 * Estimates the homography using the given context, matches and parameters to
 * PROSAC.
 *
 * The given context must have been initialized.
 *
 * The matches are provided as two arrays of N single-precision, floating-point
 * (x,y) points. Points with corresponding offsets in the two arrays constitute
 * a match. The homography estimation attempts to find the 3x3 matrix H which
 * best maps the homogeneous-coordinate points in the source array to their
 * corresponding homogeneous-coordinate points in the destination array.
 *
 *     Note: At least 4 matches must be provided (N >= 4).
 *     Note: A point in either array takes up 2 floats. The first of two stores
 *           the x-coordinate and the second of the two stores the y-coordinate.
 *           Thus, the arrays resemble this in memory:
 *
 *           src =    [x0, y0, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4, ...]
 *           Matches:     |       |       |       |       |
 *           dst =    [x0, y0, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4, ...]
 *     Note: The matches are expected to be provided sorted by quality, or at
 *           least not be worse-than-random in ordering.
 *
 * A pointer to the base of an array of N bytes can be provided. It serves as
 * an output mask to indicate whether the corresponding match is an inlier to
 * the returned homography, if any. A zero indicates an outlier; A non-zero
 * value indicates an inlier.
 *
 * The PROSAC estimator requires a few parameters of its own. These are:
 *
 *     - The maximum distance that a source point projected onto the destination
 *           plane can be from its putative match and still be considered an
 *           inlier. Must be non-negative.
 *           A sane default is 3.0.
 *     - The maximum number of PROSAC iterations. This corresponds to the
 *           largest number of samples that will be drawn and tested.
 *           A sane default is 2000.
 *     - The RANSAC convergence parameter. This corresponds to the number of
 *           iterations after which PROSAC will start sampling like RANSAC.
 *           A sane default is 2000.
 *     - The confidence threshold. This corresponds to the probability of
 *           finding a correct solution. Must be bounded by [0, 1].
 *           A sane default is 0.995.
 *     - The minimum number of inliers acceptable. Only a solution with at
 *           least this many inliers will be returned. The minimum is 4.
 *           A sane default is 10% of N.
 *     - The beta-parameter for the non-randomness termination criterion.
 *           Ignored if non-randomness criterion disabled, otherwise must be
 *           bounded by (0, 1).
 *           A sane default is 0.35.
 *     - Optional flags to control the estimation. Available flags are:
 *           HEST_FLAG_NONE:
 *               No special processing.
 *           HEST_FLAG_ENABLE_NR:
 *               Enable non-randomness criterion. If set, the beta parameter
 *               must also be set.
 *           HEST_FLAG_ENABLE_REFINEMENT:
 *               Enable refinement of each new best model, as they are found.
 *           HEST_FLAG_ENABLE_FINAL_REFINEMENT:
 *               Enable one final refinement of the best model found before
 *               returning it.
 *
 * The PROSAC estimator optionally accepts an extrinsic initial guess of H.
 *
 * The PROSAC estimator outputs a final estimate of H provided it was able to
 * find one with a minimum of supporting inliers. If it was not, it outputs
 * the all-zero matrix.
 *
 * The extrinsic guess at and final estimate of H are both in the same form:
 * A 3x3 single-precision floating-point matrix with step 3. Thus, it is a
 * 9-element array of floats, with the elements as follows:
 *
 *     [ H00, H01, H02,
 *       H10, H11, H12,
 *       H20, H21, 1.0 ]
 *
 * Notice that the homography is normalized to H22 = 1.0.
 *
 * The function returns the number of inliers if it was able to find a
 * homography with at least the minimum required support, and 0 if it was not.
 *
 *
 * @param [in,out] p       The context to use for homography estimation. Must
 *                             be already initialized. Cannot be NULL.
 * @param [in]     src     The pointer to the source points of the matches.
 *                             Must be aligned to 4 bytes. Cannot be NULL.
 * @param [in]     dst     The pointer to the destination points of the matches.
 *                             Must be aligned to 4 bytes. Cannot be NULL.
 * @param [out]    inl     The pointer to the output mask of inlier matches.
 *                             Must be aligned to 4 bytes. May be NULL.
 * @param [in]     N       The number of matches. Minimum 4.
 * @param [in]     maxD    The maximum distance. Minimum 0.
 * @param [in]     maxI    The maximum number of PROSAC iterations.
 * @param [in]     rConvg  The RANSAC convergence parameter.
 * @param [in]     cfd     The required confidence in the solution.
 * @param [in]     minInl  The minimum required number of inliers. Minimum 4.
 * @param [in]     beta    The beta-parameter for the non-randomness criterion.
 * @param [in]     flags   A union of flags to fine-tune the estimation.
 * @param [in]     guessH  An extrinsic guess at the solution H, or NULL if
 *                         none provided.
 * @param [out]    finalH  The final estimation of H, or the zero matrix if
 *                         the minimum number of inliers was not met.
 *                         Cannot be NULL.
 * @return                 The number of inliers if the minimum number of
 *                         inliers for acceptance was reached; 0 otherwise.
