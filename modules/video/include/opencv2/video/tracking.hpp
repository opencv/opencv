an object and the initial position. The mass center in window of the back projection image is
computed and the search window center shifts to the mass center. The procedure is repeated until the
specified number of iterations criteria.maxCount is done or until the window center shifts by less
than criteria.epsilon. The algorithm is used inside CamShift and, unlike CamShift , the search
window size or orientation do not change during the search. You can simply pass the output of
calcBackProject to this function. But better results can be obtained if you pre-filter the back
projection and remove the noise. For example, you can do this by retrieving connected components
with findContours , throwing away contours with small area ( contourArea ), and rendering the
remaining contours with drawContours.

@param flags operation flags:

     not set, then prevPts is copied to nextPts and is considered the initial estimate.
 -   **OPTFLOW_LK_GET_MIN_EIGENVALS** use minimum eigen values as an error measure (see
     minEigThreshold description); if the flag is not set, then L1 distance between patches
     around the original and a moved point, divided by number of pixels in a window, is used as a
     error measure.
@param minEigThreshold the algorithm calculates the minimum eigen value of a 2x2 normal matrix of
optical flow equations (this matrix is called a spatial gradient matrix in @cite Bouguet00), divided
by number of pixels in a window; if this value is less than minEigThreshold, then a corresponding
feature is filtered out and its flow is not processed, so it allows to remove bad points and get a
performance boost.

The function implements a sparse iterative version of the Lucas-Kanade optical flow in pyramids. See
@cite Bouguet00 . The function is parallelized with the TBB library.

@param flow computed flow image that has the same size as prev and type CV_32FC2.
@param pyr_scale parameter, specifying the image scale (\<1) to build pyramids for each image;
pyr_scale=0.5 means a classical pyramid, where each next layer is twice smaller than the previous
one.
@param levels number of pyramid layers including the initial image; levels=1 means that no extra
layers are created and only the original images are used.
@param winsize averaging window size; larger values increase the algorithm robustness to image
noise and give more chances for fast motion detection, but yield more blurred motion field.
@param iterations number of iterations the algorithm does at each pyramid level.
@param poly_n size of the pixel neighborhood used to find polynomial expansion in each pixel;
larger values mean that the image will be approximated with smoother surfaces, yielding more
robust algorithm and more blurred motion field, typically poly_n =5 or 7.
@param poly_sigma standard deviation of the Gaussian that is used to smooth derivatives used as a
basis for the polynomial expansion; for poly_n=5, you can set poly_sigma=1.1, for poly_n=7, a
good value would be poly_sigma=1.5.
@param flags operation flags that can be a combination of the following:
 -   **OPTFLOW_USE_INITIAL_FLOW** uses the input flow as an initial flow approximation.
 -   **OPTFLOW_FARNEBACK_GAUSSIAN** uses the Gaussian \f$\texttt{winsize}\times\texttt{winsize}\f$
     filter instead of a box filter of the same size for optical flow estimation; usually, this
     option gives z more accurate flow than with a box filter, at the cost of lower speed;
     normally, winsize for a Gaussian window should be set to a larger value to achieve the same
     level of robustness.

The function finds an optical flow for each prev pixel using the @cite Farneback2003 algorithm so that

@param src First input 2D point set stored in std::vector or Mat, or an image stored in Mat.
@param dst Second input 2D point set of the same size and the same type as A, or another image.
@param fullAffine If true, the function finds an optimal affine transformation with no additional
restrictions (6 degrees of freedom). Otherwise, the class of transformations to choose from is
limited to combinations of translation, rotation, and uniform scaling (4 degrees of freedom).

The function finds an optimal affine transform *[A|b]* (a 2 x 3 floating-point matrix) that
approximates best the affine transformation between:

*   Two point sets
*   Two raster images. In this case, the function first finds some features in the src image and
    finds the corresponding features in dst image. After that, the problem is reduced to the first
    case.
In case of point sets, the problem is formulated as follows: you need to find a 2x2 matrix *A* and
2x1 vector *b* so that:

\f[[A^*|b^*] = arg  \min _{[A|b]}  \sum _i  \| \texttt{dst}[i] - A { \texttt{src}[i]}^T - b  \| ^2\f]
where src[i] and dst[i] are the i-th points in src and dst, respectively
\f$[A|b]\f$ can be either arbitrary (when fullAffine=true ) or have a form of
\f[\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & b_1  \\ -a_{12} & a_{11} & b_2  \end{bmatrix}\f]

 -   **MOTION_AFFINE** sets an affine motion model (DEFAULT); six parameters are estimated;
     warpMatrix is \f$2\times 3\f$.
 -   **MOTION_HOMOGRAPHY** sets a homography as a motion model; eight parameters are
     estimated;\`warpMatrix\` is \f$3\times 3\f$.
@param criteria parameter, specifying the termination criteria of the ECC algorithm;
criteria.epsilon defines the threshold of the increment in the correlation coefficient between two
iterations (a negative criteria.epsilon makes criteria.maxcount the only termination criterion).
Default values are shown in the declaration above.
@param inputMask An optional mask to indicate valid values of inputImage.
@param gaussFiltSize An optional value indicating size of gaussian blur filter; (DEFAULT: 5)

The function estimates the optimum transformation (warpMatrix) with respect to ECC criterion
(@cite EP08), that is

\f[\texttt{warpMatrix} = \arg\max_{W} \texttt{ECC}(\texttt{templateImage}(x,y),\texttt{inputImage}(x',y'))\f]

where

\f[\begin{bmatrix} x' \\ y' \end{bmatrix} = W \cdot \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}\f]

(the equation holds with homogeneous coordinates for homography). It returns the final enhanced
correlation coefficient, that is the correlation coefficient between the template image and the
final warped input image. When a \f$3\times 3\f$ matrix is given with motionType =0, 1 or 2, the third
row is ignored.

Unlike findHomography and estimateRigidTransform, the function findTransformECC implements an
area-based alignment that builds on intensity similarities. In essence, the function updates the
initial transformation that roughly aligns the images. If this information is missing, the identity
warp (unity matrix) is used as an initialization. Note that if images undergo strong
displacements/rotations, an initial transformation that roughly aligns the images is necessary
(e.g., a simple euclidean/similarity transform that allows for the images showing the same image
content approximately). Use inverse warping in the second image to take an image close to the first
one, i.e. use the flag WARP_INVERSE_MAP with warpAffine or warpPerspective. See also the OpenCV
sample image_alignment.cpp that demonstrates the use of the function. Note that the function throws
an exception if algorithm does not converges.

This class implements variational refinement of the input flow field, i.e.
it uses input flow to initialize the minimization of the following functional:
\f$E(U) = \int_{\Omega} \delta \Psi(E_I) + \gamma \Psi(E_G) + \alpha \Psi(E_S) \f$,
where \f$E_I,E_G,E_S\f$ are color constancy, gradient constancy and smoothness terms
respectively. \f$\Psi(s^2)=\sqrt{s^2+\epsilon^2}\f$ is a robust penalizer to limit the
influence of outliers. A complete formulation and a description of the minimization
procedure can be found in @cite Brox2004

 *  GOTURN (@cite GOTURN) is kind of trackers based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). While taking all advantages of CNN trackers,

 *  GOTURN tracker addresses the problem of single target tracking: given a bounding box label of an object in the first frame of the video,
 *  we track that object through the rest of the video. NOTE: Current method of GOTURN does not handle occlusions; however, it is fairly

 *  Inputs of GOTURN are two RGB patches representing Target and Search patches resized to 227x227.
 *  Outputs of GOTURN are predicted bounding box coordinates, relative to Search patch coordinate system, in format X1,Y1,X2,Y2.
