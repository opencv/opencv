 *

 * The common form of a board of marker is a planar (2D) board, however any 3D layout can be used.
 * A Board object is composed by:
 * - The object points of the marker corners, i.e. their coordinates respect to the board system.
 * - The dictionary which indicates the type of markers of the board
 * - The identifier of all the markers in the board.
