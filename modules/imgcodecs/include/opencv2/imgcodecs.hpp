The `imread` function loads an image from the specified file and returns OpenCV matrix. If the image cannot be
read (because of a missing file, improper permissions, or unsupported/invalid format), the function
returns an empty matrix.

Currently, the following file formats are supported:

@note
-   The function determines the type of an image by its content, not by the file extension.
-   In the case of color images, the decoded images will have the channels stored in **B G R** order.
-   When using IMREAD_GRAYSCALE, the codec's internal grayscale conversion will be used, if available.
    Results may differ from the output of cvtColor().
-   On Microsoft Windows\* and Mac OS\*, the codecs shipped with OpenCV (libjpeg, libpng, libtiff,
    and libjasper) are used by default. So, OpenCV can always read JPEGs, PNGs, and TIFFs. On Mac OS,
    there is also an option to use native Mac OS image readers. However, beware that currently these
    native image loaders give images with different pixel values because of the color management embedded
    into Mac OS.
-   On Linux\*, BSD flavors, and other Unix-like open-source operating systems, OpenCV looks for
    codecs supplied with the OS. Ensure the relevant packages are installed (including development
    files, such as "libjpeg-dev" in Debian\* and Ubuntu\*) to get codec support, or turn
    on the OPENCV_BUILD_3RDPARTY_LIBS flag in CMake.
-   If the *WITH_GDAL* flag is set to true in CMake and @ref IMREAD_LOAD_GDAL is used to load the image,
    the [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org) driver will be used to decode the image, supporting
    [Raster](http://www.gdal.org/formats_list.html) and [Vector](http://www.gdal.org/ogr_formats.html) formats.
-   If EXIF information is embedded in the image file, the EXIF orientation will be taken into account,
    and thus the image will be rotated accordingly unless the flags @ref IMREAD_IGNORE_ORIENTATION
    or @ref IMREAD_UNCHANGED are passed.
-   Use the IMREAD_UNCHANGED flag to preserve the floating-point values from PFM images.
-   By default, the number of pixels must be less than 2^30. This limit can be changed by setting
    the environment variable `OPENCV_IO_MAX_IMAGE_PIXELS`. See @ref tutorial_env_reference.

/** @brief Saves an image to a specified file.

The function imwrite saves the image to the specified file. The image format is chosen based on the
filename extension (see cv::imread for the list of extensions). In general, only 8-bit unsigned (CV_8U)
single-channel or 3-channel (with 'BGR' channel order) images
can be saved using this function, with these exceptions:

- With OpenEXR encoder, only 32-bit float (CV_32F) images can be saved.
  - 8-bit unsigned (CV_8U) images are not supported.
- With Radiance HDR encoder, non 64-bit float (CV_64F) images can be saved.
  - All images will be converted to 32-bit float (CV_32F).
- With JPEG 2000 encoder, 8-bit unsigned (CV_8U) and 16-bit unsigned (CV_16U) images can be saved.
- With JPEG XL encoder, 8-bit unsigned (CV_8U), 16-bit unsigned (CV_16U) and 32-bit float(CV_32F) images can be saved.
  - JPEG XL images with an alpha channel can be saved using this function.
    To achieve this, create an 8-bit 4-channel (CV_8UC4) / 16-bit 4-channel (CV_16UC4) / 32-bit float 4-channel (CV_32FC4) BGRA image, ensuring the alpha channel is the last component.
    Fully transparent pixels should have an alpha value of 0, while fully opaque pixels should have an alpha value of 255/65535/1.0.
- With PAM encoder, 8-bit unsigned (CV_8U) and 16-bit unsigned (CV_16U) images can be saved.
- With PNG encoder, 8-bit unsigned (CV_8U) and 16-bit unsigned (CV_16U) images can be saved.
  - PNG images with an alpha channel can be saved using this function.
    To achieve this, create an 8-bit 4-channel (CV_8UC4) / 16-bit 4-channel (CV_16UC4) BGRA image, ensuring the alpha channel is the last component.
    Fully transparent pixels should have an alpha value of 0, while fully opaque pixels should have an alpha value of 255/65535(see the code sample below).
- With PGM/PPM encoder, 8-bit unsigned (CV_8U) and 16-bit unsigned (CV_16U) images can be saved.
- With TIFF encoder, 8-bit unsigned (CV_8U), 8-bit signed (CV_8S),
                     16-bit unsigned (CV_16U), 16-bit signed (CV_16S),
                     32-bit unsigned (CV_32U), 32-bit signed (CV_32S),
                     64-bit unsigned (CV_64U), 64-bit signed (CV_64S),
                     32-bit float (CV_32F) and 64-bit float (CV_64F) images can be saved.
  - Multiple images (vector of Mat) can be saved in TIFF format (see the code sample below).
  - 32-bit float 3-channel (CV_32FC3) TIFF images will be saved
    using the LogLuv high dynamic range encoding (4 bytes per pixel)
- With GIF encoder, 8-bit unsigned (CV_8U) images can be saved.
  - GIF images with an alpha channel can be saved using this function.
    To achieve this, create an 8-bit 4-channel (CV_8UC4) BGRA image, ensuring the alpha channel is the last component.
    Fully transparent pixels should have an alpha value of 0, while fully opaque pixels should have an alpha value of 255.
  - 8-bit single-channel images (CV_8UC1) are not supported due to GIF's limitation to indexed color formats.

If the image format is not supported, the image will be converted to 8-bit unsigned (CV_8U) and saved that way.

If the format, depth or channel order is different, use
Mat::convertTo and cv::cvtColor to convert it before saving. Or, use the universal FileStorage I/O
functions to save the image to XML or YAML format.

The sample below shows how to create a BGRA image, how to set custom compression parameters and save it to a PNG file.
It also demonstrates how to save multiple images in a TIFF file:
@include snippets/imgcodecs_imwrite.cpp
@param filename Name of the file.
@param img (Mat or vector of Mat) Image or Images to be saved.
@param params Format-specific parameters encoded as pairs (paramId_1, paramValue_1, paramId_2, paramValue_2, ... .) see cv::ImwriteFlags

/** @brief To read multi-page images on demand

The ImageCollection class provides iterator API to read multi-page images on demand. Create iterator
to the collection of the images and iterate over the collection. Decode the necessary page with operator*.

The performance of page decoding is O(1) if collection is increment sequentially. If the user wants to access random page,
then the time Complexity is O(n) because the collection has to be reinitialized every time in order to go to the correct page.
However, the intermediate pages are not decoded during the process, so typically it's quite fast.
This is required because multi-page codecs does not support going backwards.
After decoding the one page, it is stored inside the collection cache. Hence, trying to get Mat object from already decoded page is O(1).
If you need memory, you can use .releaseCache() method to release cached index.
The space complexity is O(n) if all pages are decoded into memory. The user is able to decode and release images on demand.
