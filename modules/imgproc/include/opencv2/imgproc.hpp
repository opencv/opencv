    @defgroup imgproc_filter Image Filtering

Functions and classes described in this section are used to perform various linear or non-linear
filtering operations on 2D images (represented as Mat's). It means that for each pixel location
\f$(x,y)\f$ in the source image (normally, rectangular), its neighborhood is considered and used to
compute the response. In case of a linear filter, it is a weighted sum of pixel values. In case of
morphological operations, it is the minimum or maximum values, and so on. The computed response is
stored in the destination image at the same location \f$(x,y)\f$. It means that the output image
will be of the same size as the input image. Normally, the functions support multi-channel arrays,
in which case every channel is processed independently. Therefore, the output image will also have
the same number of channels as the input one.

Another common feature of the functions and classes described in this section is that, unlike
simple arithmetic functions, they need to extrapolate values of some non-existing pixels. For
example, if you want to smooth an image using a Gaussian \f$3 \times 3\f$ filter, then, when
processing the left-most pixels in each row, you need pixels to the left of them, that is, outside
of the image. You can let these pixels be the same as the left-most image pixels ("replicated
border" extrapolation method), or assume that all the non-existing pixels are zeros ("constant
border" extrapolation method), and so on. OpenCV enables you to specify the extrapolation method.
For details, see cv::BorderTypes

@anchor filter_depths
### Depth combinations
Input depth (src.depth()) | Output depth (ddepth)
--------------------------|----------------------
CV_8U                     | -1/CV_16S/CV_32F/CV_64F
CV_16U/CV_16S             | -1/CV_32F/CV_64F
CV_32F                    | -1/CV_32F/CV_64F
CV_64F                    | -1/CV_64F

@note when ddepth=-1, the output image will have the same depth as the source.

    @defgroup imgproc_transform Geometric Image Transformations

The functions in this section perform various geometrical transformations of 2D images. They do not
change the image content but deform the pixel grid and map this deformed grid to the destination
image. In fact, to avoid sampling artifacts, the mapping is done in the reverse order, from
destination to the source. That is, for each pixel \f$(x, y)\f$ of the destination image, the
functions compute coordinates of the corresponding "donor" pixel in the source image and copy the
pixel value:

\f[\texttt{dst} (x,y)= \texttt{src} (f_x(x,y), f_y(x,y))\f]

In case when you specify the forward mapping \f$\left<g_x, g_y\right>: \texttt{src} \rightarrow
\texttt{dst}\f$, the OpenCV functions first compute the corresponding inverse mapping
\f$\left<f_x, f_y\right>: \texttt{dst} \rightarrow \texttt{src}\f$ and then use the above formula.

The actual implementations of the geometrical transformations, from the most generic remap and to
the simplest and the fastest resize, need to solve two main problems with the above formula:

- Extrapolation of non-existing pixels. Similarly to the filtering functions described in the
previous section, for some \f$(x,y)\f$, either one of \f$f_x(x,y)\f$, or \f$f_y(x,y)\f$, or both
of them may fall outside of the image. In this case, an extrapolation method needs to be used.
OpenCV provides the same selection of extrapolation methods as in the filtering functions. In
addition, it provides the method BORDER_TRANSPARENT. This means that the corresponding pixels in
the destination image will not be modified at all.

- Interpolation of pixel values. Usually \f$f_x(x,y)\f$ and \f$f_y(x,y)\f$ are floating-point
numbers. This means that \f$\left<f_x, f_y\right>\f$ can be either an affine or perspective
transformation, or radial lens distortion correction, and so on. So, a pixel value at fractional
coordinates needs to be retrieved. In the simplest case, the coordinates can be just rounded to the
nearest integer coordinates and the corresponding pixel can be used. This is called a
nearest-neighbor interpolation. However, a better result can be achieved by using more
sophisticated [interpolation methods](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_interpolation) ,
where a polynomial function is fit into some neighborhood of the computed pixel \f$(f_x(x,y),
f_y(x,y))\f$, and then the value of the polynomial at \f$(f_x(x,y), f_y(x,y))\f$ is taken as the
interpolated pixel value. In OpenCV, you can choose between several interpolation methods. See
resize for details.

    @defgroup imgproc_misc Miscellaneous Image Transformations
    @defgroup imgproc_draw Drawing Functions

Drawing functions work with matrices/images of arbitrary depth. The boundaries of the shapes can be
rendered with antialiasing (implemented only for 8-bit images for now). All the functions include
the parameter color that uses an RGB value (that may be constructed with the Scalar constructor )
for color images and brightness for grayscale images. For color images, the channel ordering is
normally *Blue, Green, Red*. This is what imshow, imread, and imwrite expect. So, if you form a
color using the Scalar constructor, it should look like:

\f[\texttt{Scalar} (blue \_ component, green \_ component, red \_ component[, alpha \_ component])\f]

If you are using your own image rendering and I/O functions, you can use any channel ordering. The
drawing functions process each channel independently and do not depend on the channel order or even
on the used color space. The whole image can be converted from BGR to RGB or to a different color
space using cvtColor .

If a drawn figure is partially or completely outside the image, the drawing functions clip it. Also,
many drawing functions can handle pixel coordinates specified with sub-pixel accuracy. This means
that the coordinates can be passed as fixed-point numbers encoded as integers. The number of
fractional bits is specified by the shift parameter and the real point coordinates are calculated as
\f$\texttt{Point}(x,y)\rightarrow\texttt{Point2f}(x*2^{-shift},y*2^{-shift})\f$ . This feature is
especially effective when rendering antialiased shapes.

@note The functions do not support alpha-transparency when the target image is 4-channel. In this
case, the color[3] is simply copied to the repainted pixels. Thus, if you want to paint
semi-transparent shapes, you can paint them in a separate buffer and then blend it with the main
image.

    @defgroup imgproc_colormap ColorMaps in OpenCV

The human perception isn't built for observing fine changes in grayscale images. Human eyes are more
sensitive to observing changes between colors, so you often need to recolor your grayscale images to
get a clue about them. OpenCV now comes with various colormaps to enhance the visualization in your
computer vision application.

In OpenCV you only need applyColorMap to apply a colormap on a given image. The following sample
code reads the path to an image from command line, applies a Jet colormap on it and shows the
result:

@code
#include <opencv2/core.hpp>
#include <opencv2/imgproc.hpp>
#include <opencv2/imgcodecs.hpp>
#include <opencv2/highgui.hpp>
using namespace cv;

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(int argc, const char *argv[])
{
    // We need an input image. (can be grayscale or color)
    if (argc < 2)
    {
        cerr << "We need an image to process here. Please run: colorMap [path_to_image]" << endl;
        return -1;
    }
    Mat img_in = imread(argv[1]);
    if(img_in.empty())
    {
        cerr << "Sample image (" << argv[1] << ") is empty. Please adjust your path, so it points to a valid input image!" << endl;
        return -1;
    }
    // Holds the colormap version of the image:
    Mat img_color;
    // Apply the colormap:
    applyColorMap(img_in, img_color, COLORMAP_JET);
    // Show the result:
    imshow("colorMap", img_color);
    waitKey(0);
    return 0;
}
@endcode

    @defgroup imgproc_subdiv2d Planar Subdivision

The Subdiv2D class described in this section is used to perform various planar subdivision on
a set of 2D points (represented as vector of Point2f). OpenCV subdivides a plane into triangles
using the Delaunay’s algorithm, which corresponds to the dual graph of the Voronoi diagram.
In the figure below, the Delaunay’s triangulation is marked with black lines and the Voronoi
diagram with red lines.

![Delaunay triangulation (black) and Voronoi (red)](pics/delaunay_voronoi.png)

The subdivisions can be used for the 3D piece-wise transformation of a plane, morphing, fast
location of points on the plane, building special graphs (such as NNG,RNG), and so forth.

very slow compared to most filters.

_Sigma values_: For simplicity, you can set the 2 sigma values to be the same. If they are small (\<
10), the filter will not have much effect, whereas if they are large (\> 150), they will have a very
strong effect, making the image look "cartoonish".

applications, and perhaps d=9 for offline applications that need heavy noise filtering.

That is, the kernel is not mirrored around the anchor point. If you need a real convolution, flip
the kernel using cv::flip and set the new anchor to `(kernel.cols - anchor.x - 1, kernel.rows -
anchor.y - 1)`.

kernel is used (that is, no Gaussian smoothing is done). `ksize = 1` can only be used for the first
or the second x- or y- derivatives.

There is also the special value `ksize = CV_SCHARR (-1)` that corresponds to the \f$3\times3\f$ Scharr
filter that may give more accurate results than the \f$3\times3\f$ Sobel. The Scharr aperture is

\f[\vecthreethree{-3}{0}{3}{-10}{0}{10}{-3}{0}{3}\f]

for the x-derivative, or transposed for the y-derivative.

The function calculates an image derivative by convolving the image with the appropriate kernel:

\f[\texttt{dst} =  \frac{\partial^{xorder+yorder} \texttt{src}}{\partial x^{xorder} \partial y^{yorder}}\f]

The Sobel operators combine Gaussian smoothing and differentiation, so the result is more or less
resistant to the noise. Most often, the function is called with ( xorder = 1, yorder = 0, ksize = 3)
or ( xorder = 0, yorder = 1, ksize = 3) to calculate the first x- or y- image derivative. The first
case corresponds to a kernel of:

\f[\vecthreethree{-1}{0}{1}{-2}{0}{2}{-1}{0}{1}\f]

The second case corresponds to a kernel of:

\f[\vecthreethree{-1}{-2}{-1}{0}{0}{0}{1}{2}{1}\f]

/** @brief Refines the corner locations.

The function iterates to find the sub-pixel accurate location of corners or radial saddle points, as
shown on the figure below.

![image](pics/cornersubpix.png)

Sub-pixel accurate corner locator is based on the observation that every vector from the center \f$q\f$
to a point \f$p\f$ located within a neighborhood of \f$q\f$ is orthogonal to the image gradient at \f$p\f$
subject to image and measurement noise. Consider the expression:

\f[\epsilon _i = {DI_{p_i}}^T  \cdot (q - p_i)\f]

where \f${DI_{p_i}}\f$ is an image gradient at one of the points \f$p_i\f$ in a neighborhood of \f$q\f$ . The
value of \f$q\f$ is to be found so that \f$\epsilon_i\f$ is minimized. A system of equations may be set up
with \f$\epsilon_i\f$ set to zero:

\f[\sum _i(DI_{p_i}  \cdot {DI_{p_i}}^T) -  \sum _i(DI_{p_i}  \cdot {DI_{p_i}}^T  \cdot p_i)\f]

where the gradients are summed within a neighborhood ("search window") of \f$q\f$ . Calling the first
gradient term \f$G\f$ and the second gradient term \f$b\f$ gives:

\f[q = G^{-1}  \cdot b\f]

The algorithm sets the center of the neighborhood window at this new center \f$q\f$ and then iterates
until the center stays within a set threshold.

@param image Input image.
@param corners Initial coordinates of the input corners and refined coordinates provided for
output.
@param winSize Half of the side length of the search window. For example, if winSize=Size(5,5) ,

the summation in the formula below is not done. It is used sometimes to avoid possible
singularities of the autocorrelation matrix. The value of (-1,-1) indicates that there is no such

@note Usually the function detects the centers of circles well. However, it may fail to find correct
radii. You can assist to the function by specifying the radius range ( minRadius and maxRadius ) if
you know it. Or, you may ignore the returned radius, use only the center, and find the correct
radius using an additional procedure.

floating-point vector \f$(x, y, radius)\f$ .
@param method Detection method, see cv::HoughModes. Currently, the only implemented method is HOUGH_GRADIENT
@param dp Inverse ratio of the accumulator resolution to the image resolution. For example, if
dp=1 , the accumulator has the same resolution as the input image. If dp=2 , the accumulator has
half as big width and height.
@param minDist Minimum distance between the centers of the detected circles. If the parameter is
too small, multiple neighbor circles may be falsely detected in addition to a true one. If it is
too large, some circles may be missed.
@param param1 First method-specific parameter. In case of CV_HOUGH_GRADIENT , it is the higher
threshold of the two passed to the Canny edge detector (the lower one is twice smaller).
@param param2 Second method-specific parameter. In case of CV_HOUGH_GRADIENT , it is the
accumulator threshold for the circle centers at the detection stage. The smaller it is, the more
false circles may be detected. Circles, corresponding to the larger accumulator values, will be
returned first.
@param minRadius Minimum circle radius.
@param maxRadius Maximum circle radius.

The function resize resizes the image src down to or up to the specified size. Note that the
initial dst type or size are not taken into account. Instead, the size and type are derived from
the `src`,`dsize`,`fx`, and `fy`. If you want to resize src so that it fits the pre-created dst,
you may call the function as follows:

Using these integral images, you can calculate sum, mean, and standard deviation over a specific

example. In case of multi-channel images, sums for each channel are accumulated independently.

Calculates the cross-power spectrum of two supplied source arrays. The arrays are padded if needed
with getOptimalDFTSize.

The function performs the following equations:
- First it applies a Hanning window (see <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hann_function>) to each
image to remove possible edge effects. This window is cached until the array size changes to speed
up processing time.
- Next it computes the forward DFTs of each source array:
\f[\mathbf{G}_a = \mathcal{F}\{src_1\}, \; \mathbf{G}_b = \mathcal{F}\{src_2\}\f]
where \f$\mathcal{F}\f$ is the forward DFT.
- It then computes the cross-power spectrum of each frequency domain array:
\f[R = \frac{ \mathbf{G}_a \mathbf{G}_b^*}{|\mathbf{G}_a \mathbf{G}_b^*|}\f]
- Next the cross-correlation is converted back into the time domain via the inverse DFT:
\f[r = \mathcal{F}^{-1}\{R\}\f]
- Finally, it computes the peak location and computes a 5x5 weighted centroid around the peak to
achieve sub-pixel accuracy.
\f[(\Delta x, \Delta y) = \texttt{weightedCentroid} \{\arg \max_{(x, y)}\{r\}\}\f]
- If non-zero, the response parameter is computed as the sum of the elements of r within the 5x5
centroid around the peak location. It is normalized to a maximum of 1 (meaning there is a single
peak) and will be smaller when there are multiple peaks.

Those pixels in the destination image, for which there is no correspondent pixels in the source

/** @brief Computes the undistortion and rectification transformation map.

The function computes the joint undistortion and rectification transformation and represents the
result in the form of maps for remap. The undistorted image looks like original, as if it is
captured with a camera using the camera matrix =newCameraMatrix and zero distortion. In case of a
monocular camera, newCameraMatrix is usually equal to cameraMatrix, or it can be computed by
cv::getOptimalNewCameraMatrix for a better control over scaling. In case of a stereo camera,
newCameraMatrix is normally set to P1 or P2 computed by cv::stereoRectify .

Also, this new camera is oriented differently in the coordinate space, according to R. That, for
example, helps to align two heads of a stereo camera so that the epipolar lines on both images
become horizontal and have the same y- coordinate (in case of a horizontally aligned stereo camera).

The function actually builds the maps for the inverse mapping algorithm that is used by remap. That
is, for each pixel \f$(u, v)\f$ in the destination (corrected and rectified) image, the function
computes the corresponding coordinates in the source image (that is, in the original image from
camera). The following process is applied:
\f[

are the distortion coefficients.

In case of a stereo camera, this function is called twice: once for each camera head, after
stereoRectify, which in its turn is called after cv::stereoCalibrate. But if the stereo camera
was not calibrated, it is still possible to compute the rectification transformations directly from
the fundamental matrix using cv::stereoRectifyUncalibrated. For each camera, the function computes
homography H as the rectification transformation in a pixel domain, not a rotation matrix R in 3D

move the principal point. However, when you work with stereo, it is important to move the principal

/** @brief Calculates the back projection of a histogram.

The function cv::calcBackProject calculates the back project of the histogram. That is, similarly to
cv::calcHist , at each location (x, y) the function collects the values from the selected channels
in the input images and finds the corresponding histogram bin. But instead of incrementing it, the
function reads the bin value, scales it by scale , and stores in backProject(x,y) . In terms of
statistics, the function computes probability of each element value in respect with the empirical
probability distribution represented by the histogram. See how, for example, you can find and track
a bright-colored object in a scene:

- Before tracking, show the object to the camera so that it covers almost the whole frame.
Calculate a hue histogram. The histogram may have strong maximums, corresponding to the dominant
colors in the object.

- When tracking, calculate a back projection of a hue plane of each input video frame using that
pre-computed histogram. Threshold the back projection to suppress weak colors. It may also make
sense to suppress pixels with non-sufficient color saturation and too dark or too bright pixels.

- Find connected components in the resulting picture and choose, for example, the largest
component.

This is an approximate algorithm of the CamShift color object tracker.

/** @brief Computes the "minimal work" distance between two weighted point configurations.

The function computes the earth mover distance and/or a lower boundary of the distance between the
two weighted point configurations. One of the applications described in @cite RubnerSept98,
@cite Rubner2000 is multi-dimensional histogram comparison for image retrieval. EMD is a transportation
problem that is solved using some modification of a simplex algorithm, thus the complexity is
exponential in the worst case, though, on average it is much faster. In the case of a real metric
the lower boundary can be calculated even faster (using linear-time algorithm) and it can be used
to determine roughly whether the two signatures are far enough so that they cannot relate to the
same object.

@param signature1 First signature, a \f$\texttt{size1}\times \texttt{dims}+1\f$ floating-point matrix.
Each row stores the point weight followed by the point coordinates. The matrix is allowed to have
a single column (weights only) if the user-defined cost matrix is used. The weights must be
non-negative and have at least one non-zero value.
@param signature2 Second signature of the same format as signature1 , though the number of rows
may be different. The total weights may be different. In this case an extra "dummy" point is added
to either signature1 or signature2. The weights must be non-negative and have at least one non-zero
value.
@param distType Used metric. See cv::DistanceTypes.
@param cost User-defined \f$\texttt{size1}\times \texttt{size2}\f$ cost matrix. Also, if a cost matrix
is used, lower boundary lowerBound cannot be calculated because it needs a metric function.
@param lowerBound Optional input/output parameter: lower boundary of a distance between the two
signatures that is a distance between mass centers. The lower boundary may not be calculated if
the user-defined cost matrix is used, the total weights of point configurations are not equal, or
if the signatures consist of weights only (the signature matrices have a single column). You
**must** initialize \*lowerBound . If the calculated distance between mass centers is greater or
equal to \*lowerBound (it means that the signatures are far enough), the function does not
calculate EMD. In any case \*lowerBound is set to the calculated distance between mass centers on
return. Thus, if you want to calculate both distance between mass centers and EMD, \*lowerBound
should be set to 0.
@param flow Resultant \f$\texttt{size1} \times \texttt{size2}\f$ flow matrix: \f$\texttt{flow}_{i,j}\f$ is

The function implements one of the variants of watershed, non-parametric marker-based segmentation

Before passing the image to the function, you have to roughly outline the desired regions in the
image markers with positive (\>0) indices. So, every region is represented as one or more connected
components with the pixel values 1, 2, 3, and so on. Such markers can be retrieved from a binary
mask using findContours and drawContours (see the watershed.cpp demo). The markers are "seeds" of
the future image regions. All the other pixels in markers , whose relation to the outlined regions
is not known and should be defined by the algorithm, should be set to 0's. In the function output,
each pixel in markers is set to a value of the "seed" components or to -1 at boundaries between the

/** @brief Performs initial step of meanshift segmentation of an image.

The function implements the filtering stage of meanshift segmentation, that is, the output of the
function is the filtered "posterized" image with color gradients and fine-grain texture flattened.
At every pixel (X,Y) of the input image (or down-sized input image, see below) the function executes
meanshift iterations, that is, the pixel (X,Y) neighborhood in the joint space-color hyperspace is
considered:

\f[(x,y): X- \texttt{sp} \le x  \le X+ \texttt{sp} , Y- \texttt{sp} \le y  \le Y+ \texttt{sp} , ||(R,G,B)-(r,g,b)||   \le \texttt{sr}\f]

where (R,G,B) and (r,g,b) are the vectors of color components at (X,Y) and (x,y), respectively
(though, the algorithm does not depend on the color space used, so any 3-component color space can
be used instead). Over the neighborhood the average spatial value (X',Y') and average color vector
(R',G',B') are found and they act as the neighborhood center on the next iteration:

\f[(X,Y)~(X',Y'), (R,G,B)~(R',G',B').\f]

After the iterations over, the color components of the initial pixel (that is, the pixel from where
the iterations started) are set to the final value (average color at the last iteration):

\f[I(X,Y) <- (R*,G*,B*)\f]

When maxLevel \> 0, the gaussian pyramid of maxLevel+1 levels is built, and the above procedure is
run on the smallest layer first. After that, the results are propagated to the larger layer and the
iterations are run again only on those pixels where the layer colors differ by more than sr from the
lower-resolution layer of the pyramid. That makes boundaries of color regions sharper. Note that the
results will be actually different from the ones obtained by running the meanshift procedure on the
whole original image (i.e. when maxLevel==0).

/** @brief Calculates the distance to the closest zero pixel for each pixel of the source image.

The functions distanceTransform calculate the approximate or precise distance from every binary
image pixel to the nearest zero pixel. For zero image pixels, the distance will obviously be zero.

When maskSize == DIST_MASK_PRECISE and distanceType == DIST_L2 , the function runs the
algorithm described in @cite Felzenszwalb04 . This algorithm is parallelized with the TBB library.

In other cases, the algorithm @cite Borgefors86 is used. This means that for a pixel the function
finds the shortest path to the nearest zero pixel consisting of basic shifts: horizontal, vertical,
diagonal, or knight's move (the latest is available for a \f$5\times 5\f$ mask). The overall
distance is calculated as a sum of these basic distances. Since the distance function should be
symmetric, all of the horizontal and vertical shifts must have the same cost (denoted as a ), all
the diagonal shifts must have the same cost (denoted as `b`), and all knight's moves must have the
same cost (denoted as `c`). For the cv::DIST_C and cv::DIST_L1 types, the distance is calculated
precisely, whereas for cv::DIST_L2 (Euclidean distance) the distance can be calculated only with a
relative error (a \f$5\times 5\f$ mask gives more accurate results). For `a`,`b`, and `c`, OpenCV
uses the values suggested in the original paper:
- DIST_L1: `a = 1, b = 2`
- DIST_L2:
    - `3 x 3`: `a=0.955, b=1.3693`
    - `5 x 5`: `a=1, b=1.4, c=2.1969`
- DIST_C: `a = 1, b = 1`

Typically, for a fast, coarse distance estimation DIST_L2, a \f$3\times 3\f$ mask is used. For a
more accurate distance estimation DIST_L2, a \f$5\times 5\f$ mask or the precise algorithm is used.
Note that both the precise and the approximate algorithms are linear on the number of pixels.

This variant of the function does not only compute the minimum distance for each pixel \f$(x, y)\f$
but also identifies the nearest connected component consisting of zero pixels
(labelType==DIST_LABEL_CCOMP) or the nearest zero pixel (labelType==DIST_LABEL_PIXEL). Index of the
component/pixel is stored in `labels(x, y)`. When labelType==DIST_LABEL_CCOMP, the function
automatically finds connected components of zero pixels in the input image and marks them with
distinct labels. When labelType==DIST_LABEL_CCOMP, the function scans through the input image and
marks all the zero pixels with distinct labels.

In this mode, the complexity is still linear. That is, the function provides a very fast way to
compute the Voronoi diagram for a binary image. Currently, the second variant can use only the
approximate distance transform algorithm, i.e. maskSize=DIST_MASK_PRECISE is not supported
yet.

component. That is, to be added to the connected component, a color/brightness of the pixel should
be close enough to:
- Color/brightness of one of its neighbors that already belong to the connected component in case
of a floating range.
- Color/brightness of the seed point in case of a fixed range.

Use these functions to either mark a connected component with the specified color in-place, or build
a mask and then extract the contour, or copy the region to another image, and so on.

@param image Input/output 1- or 3-channel, 8-bit, or floating-point image. It is modified by the
function unless the FLOODFILL_MASK_ONLY flag is set in the second variant of the function. See
the details below.
@param mask Operation mask that should be a single-channel 8-bit image, 2 pixels wider and 2 pixels
taller than image. Since this is both an input and output parameter, you must take responsibility
of initializing it. Flood-filling cannot go across non-zero pixels in the input mask. For example,
an edge detector output can be used as a mask to stop filling at edges. On output, pixels in the
mask corresponding to filled pixels in the image are set to 1 or to the a value specified in flags
as described below. It is therefore possible to use the same mask in multiple calls to the function
to make sure the filled areas do not overlap.
@param seedPoint Starting point.
@param newVal New value of the repainted domain pixels.
@param loDiff Maximal lower brightness/color difference between the currently observed pixel and
one of its neighbors belonging to the component, or a seed pixel being added to the component.
@param upDiff Maximal upper brightness/color difference between the currently observed pixel and
one of its neighbors belonging to the component, or a seed pixel being added to the component.
@param rect Optional output parameter set by the function to the minimum bounding rectangle of the
repainted domain.
@param flags Operation flags. The first 8 bits contain a connectivity value. The default value of
4 means that only the four nearest neighbor pixels (those that share an edge) are considered. A
connectivity value of 8 means that the eight nearest neighbor pixels (those that share a corner)
will be considered. The next 8 bits (8-16) contain a value between 1 and 255 with which to fill
the mask (the default value is 1). For example, 4 | ( 255 \<\< 8 ) will consider 4 nearest
neighbours and fill the mask with a value of 255. The following additional options occupy higher
bits and therefore may be further combined with the connectivity and mask fill values using
bit-wise or (|), see cv::FloodFillFlags.

@note Since the mask is larger than the filled image, a pixel \f$(x, y)\f$ in image corresponds to the
pixel \f$(x+1, y+1)\f$ in the mask .

/** @brief Converts an image from one color space to another.

The function converts an input image from one color space to another. In case of a transformation
to-from RGB color space, the order of the channels should be specified explicitly (RGB or BGR). Note
that the default color format in OpenCV is often referred to as RGB but it is actually BGR (the
bytes are reversed). So the first byte in a standard (24-bit) color image will be an 8-bit Blue
component, the second byte will be Green, and the third byte will be Red. The fourth, fifth, and
sixth bytes would then be the second pixel (Blue, then Green, then Red), and so on.

The conventional ranges for R, G, and B channel values are:
-   0 to 255 for CV_8U images
-   0 to 65535 for CV_16U images
-   0 to 1 for CV_32F images

In case of linear transformations, the range does not matter. But in case of a non-linear
transformation, an input RGB image should be normalized to the proper value range to get the correct
results, for example, for RGB \f$\rightarrow\f$ L\*u\*v\* transformation. For example, if you have a
32-bit floating-point image directly converted from an 8-bit image without any scaling, then it will
have the 0..255 value range instead of 0..1 assumed by the function. So, before calling cvtColor ,
you need first to scale the image down:
@code
    img *= 1./255;
    cvtColor(img, img, COLOR_BGR2Luv);
@endcode
If you use cvtColor with 8-bit images, the conversion will have some information lost. For many
applications, this will not be noticeable but it is recommended to use 32-bit images in applications
that need the full range of colors or that convert an image before an operation and then convert
back.

If conversion adds the alpha channel, its value will set to the maximum of corresponding channel
range: 255 for CV_8U, 65535 for CV_16U, 1 for CV_32F.

@param src input image: 8-bit unsigned, 16-bit unsigned ( CV_16UC... ), or single-precision
floating-point.
@param dst output image of the same size and depth as src.
@param code color space conversion code (see cv::ColorConversionCodes).

/** @brief Line iterator

The class is used to iterate over all the pixels on the raster line
segment connecting two specified points.

The class LineIterator is used to get each pixel of a raster line. It
can be treated as versatile implementation of the Bresenham algorithm
where you can stop at each pixel and do some extra processing, for
example, grab pixel values along the line or draw a line with an effect
(for example, with XOR operation).

The number of pixels along the line is stored in LineIterator::count.
The method LineIterator::pos returns the current position in the image:

@code{.cpp}
// grabs pixels along the line (pt1, pt2)
// from 8-bit 3-channel image to the buffer
LineIterator it(img, pt1, pt2, 8);
LineIterator it2 = it;
vector<Vec3b> buf(it.count);

for(int i = 0; i < it.count; i++, ++it)
    buf[i] = *(const Vec3b)*it;

// alternative way of iterating through the line
for(int i = 0; i < it2.count; i++, ++it2)
{
    Vec3b val = img.at<Vec3b>(it2.pos());
    CV_Assert(buf[i] == val);
}
