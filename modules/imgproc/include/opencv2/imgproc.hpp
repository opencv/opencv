@defgroup imgproc Image Processing

This module offers a comprehensive suite of image processing functions, enabling tasks such as those listed above.

@{
    @defgroup imgproc_filter Image Filtering

    Functions and classes described in this section are used to perform various linear or non-linear
    filtering operations on 2D images (represented as Mat's). It means that for each pixel location
    \f$(x,y)\f$ in the source image (normally, rectangular), its neighborhood is considered and used to
    compute the response. In case of a linear filter, it is a weighted sum of pixel values. In case of
    morphological operations, it is the minimum or maximum values, and so on. The computed response is
    stored in the destination image at the same location \f$(x,y)\f$. It means that the output image
    will be of the same size as the input image. Normally, the functions support multi-channel arrays,
    in which case every channel is processed independently. Therefore, the output image will also have
    the same number of channels as the input one.

    Another common feature of the functions and classes described in this section is that, unlike
    simple arithmetic functions, they need to extrapolate values of some non-existing pixels. For
    example, if you want to smooth an image using a Gaussian \f$3 \times 3\f$ filter, then, when
    processing the left-most pixels in each row, you need pixels to the left of them, that is, outside
    of the image. You can let these pixels be the same as the left-most image pixels ("replicated
    border" extrapolation method), or assume that all the non-existing pixels are zeros ("constant
    border" extrapolation method), and so on. OpenCV enables you to specify the extrapolation method.
    For details, see #BorderTypes

    @anchor filter_depths
    ### Depth combinations
    Input depth (src.depth()) | Output depth (ddepth)
    --------------------------|----------------------
    CV_8U                     | -1/CV_16S/CV_32F/CV_64F
    CV_16U/CV_16S             | -1/CV_32F/CV_64F
    CV_32F                    | -1/CV_32F
    CV_64F                    | -1/CV_64F

    @note when ddepth=-1, the output image will have the same depth as the source.

    @note if you need double floating-point accuracy and using single floating-point input data
    (CV_32F input and CV_64F output depth combination), you can use @ref Mat.convertTo to convert
    the input data to the desired precision.

    @defgroup imgproc_transform Geometric Image Transformations

    The functions in this section perform various geometrical transformations of 2D images. They do not
    change the image content but deform the pixel grid and map this deformed grid to the destination
    image. In fact, to avoid sampling artifacts, the mapping is done in the reverse order, from
    destination to the source. That is, for each pixel \f$(x, y)\f$ of the destination image, the
    functions compute coordinates of the corresponding "donor" pixel in the source image and copy the
    pixel value:

    \f[\texttt{dst} (x,y)= \texttt{src} (f_x(x,y), f_y(x,y))\f]

    In case when you specify the forward mapping \f$\left<g_x, g_y\right>: \texttt{src} \rightarrow
    \texttt{dst}\f$, the OpenCV functions first compute the corresponding inverse mapping
    \f$\left<f_x, f_y\right>: \texttt{dst} \rightarrow \texttt{src}\f$ and then use the above formula.

    The actual implementations of the geometrical transformations, from the most generic remap and to
    the simplest and the fastest resize, need to solve two main problems with the above formula:

    - Extrapolation of non-existing pixels. Similarly to the filtering functions described in the
    previous section, for some \f$(x,y)\f$, either one of \f$f_x(x,y)\f$, or \f$f_y(x,y)\f$, or both
    of them may fall outside of the image. In this case, an extrapolation method needs to be used.
    OpenCV provides the same selection of extrapolation methods as in the filtering functions. In
    addition, it provides the method #BORDER_TRANSPARENT. This means that the corresponding pixels in
    the destination image will not be modified at all.

    - Interpolation of pixel values. Usually \f$f_x(x,y)\f$ and \f$f_y(x,y)\f$ are floating-point
    numbers. This means that \f$\left<f_x, f_y\right>\f$ can be either an affine or perspective
    transformation, or radial lens distortion correction, and so on. So, a pixel value at fractional
    coordinates needs to be retrieved. In the simplest case, the coordinates can be just rounded to the
    nearest integer coordinates and the corresponding pixel can be used. This is called a
    nearest-neighbor interpolation. However, a better result can be achieved by using more
    sophisticated [interpolation methods](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_interpolation) ,
    where a polynomial function is fit into some neighborhood of the computed pixel \f$(f_x(x,y),
    f_y(x,y))\f$, and then the value of the polynomial at \f$(f_x(x,y), f_y(x,y))\f$ is taken as the
    interpolated pixel value. In OpenCV, you can choose between several interpolation methods. See
    #resize for details.

    @note The geometrical transformations do not work with `CV_8S` or `CV_32S` images.

    @defgroup imgproc_misc Miscellaneous Image Transformations
    @defgroup imgproc_draw Drawing Functions

    Drawing functions work with matrices/images of arbitrary depth. The boundaries of the shapes can be
    rendered with antialiasing (implemented only for 8-bit images for now). All the functions include
    the parameter color that uses an RGB value (that may be constructed with the Scalar constructor )
    for color images and brightness for grayscale images. For color images, the channel ordering is
    normally *Blue, Green, Red*. This is what imshow, imread, and imwrite expect. So, if you form a
    color using the Scalar constructor, it should look like:

    \f[\texttt{Scalar} (blue \_ component, green \_ component, red \_ component[, alpha \_ component])\f]

    If you are using your own image rendering and I/O functions, you can use any channel ordering. The
    drawing functions process each channel independently and do not depend on the channel order or even
    on the used color space. The whole image can be converted from BGR to RGB or to a different color
    space using cvtColor .

    If a drawn figure is partially or completely outside the image, the drawing functions clip it. Also,
    many drawing functions can handle pixel coordinates specified with sub-pixel accuracy. This means
    that the coordinates can be passed as fixed-point numbers encoded as integers. The number of
    fractional bits is specified by the shift parameter and the real point coordinates are calculated as
    \f$\texttt{Point}(x,y)\rightarrow\texttt{Point2f}(x*2^{-shift},y*2^{-shift})\f$ . This feature is
    especially effective when rendering antialiased shapes.

    @note The functions do not support alpha-transparency when the target image is 4-channel. In this
    case, the color[3] is simply copied to the repainted pixels. Thus, if you want to paint
    semi-transparent shapes, you can paint them in a separate buffer and then blend it with the main
    image.

    @defgroup imgproc_color_conversions Color Space Conversions
    @defgroup imgproc_colormap ColorMaps in OpenCV

    The human perception isn't built for observing fine changes in grayscale images. Human eyes are more
    sensitive to observing changes between colors, so you often need to recolor your grayscale images to
    get a clue about them. OpenCV now comes with various colormaps to enhance the visualization in your
    computer vision application.

    In OpenCV you only need applyColorMap to apply a colormap on a given image. The following sample
    code reads the path to an image from command line, applies a Jet colormap on it and shows the
    result:

    @include snippets/imgproc_applyColorMap.cpp

    @see #ColormapTypes

    @defgroup imgproc_subdiv2d Planar Subdivision

    The Subdiv2D class described in this section is used to perform various planar subdivision on
    a set of 2D points (represented as vector of Point2f). OpenCV subdivides a plane into triangles
    using the Delaunay's algorithm, which corresponds to the dual graph of the Voronoi diagram.
    In the figure below, the Delaunay's triangulation is marked with black lines and the Voronoi
    diagram with red lines.

    ![Delaunay triangulation (black) and Voronoi (red)](pics/delaunay_voronoi.png)

    The subdivisions can be used for the 3D piece-wise transformation of a plane, morphing, fast
    location of points on the plane, building special graphs (such as NNG,RNG), and so forth.

The function applies bilateral filtering to the input image, as described in
http://www.dai.ed.ac.uk/CVonline/LOCAL_COPIES/MANDUCHI1/Bilateral_Filtering.html
bilateralFilter can reduce unwanted noise very well while keeping edges fairly sharp. However, it is
very slow compared to most filters.

_Sigma values_: For simplicity, you can set the 2 sigma values to be the same. If they are small (\<
10), the filter will not have much effect, whereas if they are large (\> 150), they will have a very
strong effect, making the image look "cartoonish".

applications, and perhaps d=9 for offline applications that need heavy noise filtering.

This filter does not work inplace.

farther colors within the pixel neighborhood (see sigmaSpace) will be mixed together, resulting
in larger areas of semi-equal color.
@param sigmaSpace Filter sigma in the coordinate space. A larger value of the parameter means that
farther pixels will influence each other as long as their colors are close enough (see sigmaColor
). When d\>0, it specifies the neighborhood size regardless of sigmaSpace. Otherwise, d is

depending on if they are on the right or on the left side of the stack. The only supported borderType is BORDER_REPLICATE.

/** @brief Convolves an image with the kernel.

The function applies an arbitrary linear filter to an image. In-place operation is supported. When

according to the specified border mode.

The function does actually compute correlation, not the convolution:

\f[\texttt{dst} (x,y) =  \sum _{ \substack{0\leq x' < \texttt{kernel.cols}\\{0\leq y' < \texttt{kernel.rows}}}}  \texttt{kernel} (x',y')* \texttt{src} (x+x'- \texttt{anchor.x} ,y+y'- \texttt{anchor.y} )\f]

That is, the kernel is not mirrored around the anchor point. If you need a real convolution, flip
the kernel using #flip and set the new anchor to `(kernel.cols - anchor.x - 1, kernel.rows -
anchor.y - 1)`.

The function uses the DFT-based algorithm in case of sufficiently large kernels (~`11 x 11` or

/** @brief Calculates the first, second, third, or mixed image derivatives using an extended Sobel operator.

In all cases except one, the \f$\texttt{ksize} \times \texttt{ksize}\f$ separable kernel is used to
calculate the derivative. When \f$\texttt{ksize = 1}\f$, the \f$3 \times 1\f$ or \f$1 \times 3\f$
kernel is used (that is, no Gaussian smoothing is done). `ksize = 1` can only be used for the first
or the second x- or y- derivatives.

There is also the special value `ksize = #FILTER_SCHARR (-1)` that corresponds to the \f$3\times3\f$ Scharr
filter that may give more accurate results than the \f$3\times3\f$ Sobel. The Scharr aperture is

\f[\vecthreethree{-3}{0}{3}{-10}{0}{10}{-3}{0}{3}\f]

for the x-derivative, or transposed for the y-derivative.

The function calculates an image derivative by convolving the image with the appropriate kernel:

\f[\texttt{dst} =  \frac{\partial^{xorder+yorder} \texttt{src}}{\partial x^{xorder} \partial y^{yorder}}\f]

The Sobel operators combine Gaussian smoothing and differentiation, so the result is more or less
resistant to the noise. Most often, the function is called with ( xorder = 1, yorder = 0, ksize = 3)
or ( xorder = 0, yorder = 1, ksize = 3) to calculate the first x- or y- image derivative. The first
case corresponds to a kernel of:

\f[\vecthreethree{-1}{0}{1}{-2}{0}{2}{-1}{0}{1}\f]

The second case corresponds to a kernel of:

\f[\vecthreethree{-1}{-2}{-1}{0}{0}{0}{1}{2}{1}\f]

The function iterates to find the sub-pixel accurate location of corners or radial saddle
points as described in @cite forstner1987fast, and as shown on the figure below.

![image](pics/cornersubpix.png)

Sub-pixel accurate corner locator is based on the observation that every vector from the center \f$q\f$
to a point \f$p\f$ located within a neighborhood of \f$q\f$ is orthogonal to the image gradient at \f$p\f$
subject to image and measurement noise. Consider the expression:

\f[\epsilon _i = {DI_{p_i}}^T  \cdot (q - p_i)\f]

where \f${DI_{p_i}}\f$ is an image gradient at one of the points \f$p_i\f$ in a neighborhood of \f$q\f$ . The
value of \f$q\f$ is to be found so that \f$\epsilon_i\f$ is minimized. A system of equations may be set up
with \f$\epsilon_i\f$ set to zero:

\f[\sum _i(DI_{p_i}  \cdot {DI_{p_i}}^T) \cdot q -  \sum _i(DI_{p_i}  \cdot {DI_{p_i}}^T  \cdot p_i)\f]

where the gradients are summed within a neighborhood ("search window") of \f$q\f$ . Calling the first
gradient term \f$G\f$ and the second gradient term \f$b\f$ gives:

\f[q = G^{-1}  \cdot b\f]

The algorithm sets the center of the neighborhood window at this new center \f$q\f$ and then iterates
until the center stays within a set threshold.

@param image Input single-channel, 8-bit or float image.
@param corners Initial coordinates of the input corners and refined coordinates provided for
output.
@param winSize Half of the side length of the search window. For example, if winSize=Size(5,5) ,

the summation in the formula below is not done. It is used sometimes to avoid possible
singularities of the autocorrelation matrix. The value of (-1,-1) indicates that there is no such
a size.

the process of corner position refinement stops either after criteria.maxCount iterations or when
the corner position moves by less than criteria.epsilon on some iteration.

/** @brief Finds circles in a grayscale image using the Hough transform.

The function finds circles in a grayscale image using a modification of the Hough transform.

Example: :
@include snippets/imgproc_HoughLinesCircles.cpp

@note Usually the function detects the centers of circles well. However, it may fail to find correct
radii. You can assist to the function by specifying the radius range ( minRadius and maxRadius ) if
you know it. Or, in the case of #HOUGH_GRADIENT method you may set maxRadius to a negative number
to return centers only without radius search, and find the correct radius using an additional procedure.

It also helps to smooth image a bit unless it's already soft. For example,
GaussianBlur() with 7x7 kernel and 1.5x1.5 sigma or similar blurring may help.

@param image 8-bit, single-channel, grayscale input image.
@param circles Output vector of found circles. Each vector is encoded as  3 or 4 element
floating-point vector \f$(x, y, radius)\f$ or \f$(x, y, radius, votes)\f$ .
@param method Detection method, see #HoughModes. The available methods are #HOUGH_GRADIENT and #HOUGH_GRADIENT_ALT.
@param dp Inverse ratio of the accumulator resolution to the image resolution. For example, if
dp=1 , the accumulator has the same resolution as the input image. If dp=2 , the accumulator has
half as big width and height. For #HOUGH_GRADIENT_ALT the recommended value is dp=1.5,
unless some small very circles need to be detected.
@param minDist Minimum distance between the centers of the detected circles. If the parameter is
too small, multiple neighbor circles may be falsely detected in addition to a true one. If it is
too large, some circles may be missed.
@param param1 First method-specific parameter. In case of #HOUGH_GRADIENT and #HOUGH_GRADIENT_ALT,
it is the higher threshold of the two passed to the Canny edge detector (the lower one is twice smaller).
Note that #HOUGH_GRADIENT_ALT uses #Scharr algorithm to compute image derivatives, so the threshold value
should normally be higher, such as 300 or normally exposed and contrasty images.
@param param2 Second method-specific parameter. In case of #HOUGH_GRADIENT, it is the
accumulator threshold for the circle centers at the detection stage. The smaller it is, the more
false circles may be detected. Circles, corresponding to the larger accumulator values, will be
returned first. In the case of #HOUGH_GRADIENT_ALT algorithm, this is the circle "perfectness" measure.
The closer it to 1, the better shaped circles algorithm selects. In most cases 0.9 should be fine.
If you want get better detection of small circles, you may decrease it to 0.85, 0.8 or even less.
But then also try to limit the search range [minRadius, maxRadius] to avoid many false circles.
@param minRadius Minimum circle radius.
@param maxRadius Maximum circle radius. If <= 0, uses the maximum image dimension. If < 0, #HOUGH_GRADIENT returns
centers without finding the radius. #HOUGH_GRADIENT_ALT always computes circle radiuses.

The function resize resizes the image src down to or up to the specified size. Note that the

\par Linear vs semilog mapping

Polar mapping can be linear or semi-log. Add one of #WarpPolarMode to `flags` to specify the polar mapping mode.

Linear is the default mode.

The semilog mapping emulates the human "foveal" vision that permit very high acuity on the line of sight (central vision)
in contrast to peripheral vision where acuity is minor.

\par Option on `dsize`:

- if both values in `dsize <=0 ` (default),
the destination image will have (almost) same area of source bounding circle:
\f[\begin{array}{l}
dsize.area  \leftarrow (maxRadius^2 \cdot \Pi) \\
dsize.width = \texttt{cvRound}(maxRadius) \\
dsize.height = \texttt{cvRound}(maxRadius \cdot \Pi) \\
\end{array}\f]


- if only `dsize.height <= 0`,
the destination image area will be proportional to the bounding circle area but scaled by `Kx * Kx`:
\f[\begin{array}{l}
dsize.height = \texttt{cvRound}(dsize.width \cdot \Pi) \\
\end{array}
\f]

- if both values in `dsize > 0 `,
the destination image will have the given size therefore the area of the bounding circle will be scaled to `dsize`.


\par Reverse mapping

You can get reverse mapping adding #WARP_INVERSE_MAP to `flags`
\snippet polar_transforms.cpp InverseMap

In addiction, to calculate the original coordinate from a polar mapped coordinate \f$(rho, phi)->(x, y)\f$:
\snippet polar_transforms.cpp InverseCoordinate

@param src Source image.
@param dst Destination image. It will have same type as src.
@param dsize The destination image size (see description for valid options).
@param center The transformation center.
@param maxRadius The radius of the bounding circle to transform. It determines the inverse magnitude scale parameter too.
@param flags A combination of interpolation methods, #InterpolationFlags + #WarpPolarMode.
            - Add #WARP_POLAR_LINEAR to select linear polar mapping (default)
            - Add #WARP_POLAR_LOG to select semilog polar mapping
            - Add #WARP_INVERSE_MAP for reverse mapping.

/** @brief Calculates the integral of an image.

The function calculates one or more integral images for the source image as follows:

\f[\texttt{sum} (X,Y) =  \sum _{x<X,y<Y}  \texttt{image} (x,y)\f]

\f[\texttt{sqsum} (X,Y) =  \sum _{x<X,y<Y}  \texttt{image} (x,y)^2\f]

\f[\texttt{tilted} (X,Y) =  \sum _{y<Y,abs(x-X+1) \leq Y-y-1}  \texttt{image} (x,y)\f]

Using these integral images, you can calculate sum, mean, and standard deviation over a specific
up-right or rotated rectangular region of the image in a constant time, for example:

\f[\sum _{x_1 \leq x < x_2,  \, y_1  \leq y < y_2}  \texttt{image} (x,y) =  \texttt{sum} (x_2,y_2)- \texttt{sum} (x_1,y_2)- \texttt{sum} (x_2,y_1)+ \texttt{sum} (x_1,y_1)\f]

It makes possible to do a fast blurring or fast block correlation with a variable window size, for
example. In case of multi-channel images, sums for each channel are accumulated independently.

As a practical example, the next figure shows the calculation of the integral of a straight
rectangle Rect(4,4,3,2) and of a tilted rectangle Rect(5,1,2,3) . The selected pixels in the
original image are shown, as well as the relative pixels in the integral images sum and tilted .

more information please see <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_correlation>

Calculates the cross-power spectrum of two supplied source arrays. The arrays are padded if needed
with getOptimalDFTSize.

The function performs the following equations:
- First it applies a Hanning window (see <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hann_function>) to each
image to remove possible edge effects. This window is cached until the array size changes to speed
up processing time.
- Next it computes the forward DFTs of each source array:
\f[\mathbf{G}_a = \mathcal{F}\{src_1\}, \; \mathbf{G}_b = \mathcal{F}\{src_2\}\f]
where \f$\mathcal{F}\f$ is the forward DFT.
- It then computes the cross-power spectrum of each frequency domain array:
\f[R = \frac{ \mathbf{G}_a \mathbf{G}_b^*}{|\mathbf{G}_a \mathbf{G}_b^*|}\f]
- Next the cross-correlation is converted back into the time domain via the inverse DFT:
\f[r = \mathcal{F}^{-1}\{R\}\f]
- Finally, it computes the peak location and computes a 5x5 weighted centroid around the peak to
achieve sub-pixel accuracy.
\f[(\Delta x, \Delta y) = \texttt{weightedCentroid} \{\arg \max_{(x, y)}\{r\}\}\f]
- If non-zero, the response parameter is computed as the sum of the elements of r within the 5x5
centroid around the peak location. It is normalized to a maximum of 1 (meaning there is a single
peak) and will be smaller when there are multiple peaks.

\f$U_{\texttt{histSize}[i]-1}\f$ for the last histogram bin histSize[i]-1 . That is, in case of a
uniform histogram each of ranges[i] is an array of 2 elements. When the histogram is not uniform (

counted in the histogram.
@param uniform Flag indicating whether the histogram is uniform or not (see above).

/** @brief Calculates the back projection of a histogram.

The function cv::calcBackProject calculates the back project of the histogram. That is, similarly to
#calcHist , at each location (x, y) the function collects the values from the selected channels
in the input images and finds the corresponding histogram bin. But instead of incrementing it, the
function reads the bin value, scales it by scale , and stores in backProject(x,y) . In terms of
statistics, the function computes probability of each element value in respect with the empirical
probability distribution represented by the histogram. See how, for example, you can find and track
a bright-colored object in a scene:

- Before tracking, show the object to the camera so that it covers almost the whole frame.
Calculate a hue histogram. The histogram may have strong maximums, corresponding to the dominant
colors in the object.

- When tracking, calculate a back projection of a hue plane of each input video frame using that
pre-computed histogram. Threshold the back projection to suppress weak colors. It may also make
sense to suppress pixels with non-sufficient color saturation and too dark or too bright pixels.

- Find connected components in the resulting picture and choose, for example, the largest
component.

This is an approximate algorithm of the CamShift color object tracker.

The function computes the earth mover distance and/or a lower boundary of the distance between the
two weighted point configurations. One of the applications described in @cite RubnerSept98,
@cite Rubner2000 is multi-dimensional histogram comparison for image retrieval. EMD is a transportation
problem that is solved using some modification of a simplex algorithm, thus the complexity is
exponential in the worst case, though, on average it is much faster. In the case of a real metric
the lower boundary can be calculated even faster (using linear-time algorithm) and it can be used
to determine roughly whether the two signatures are far enough so that they cannot relate to the
same object.

@param signature1 First signature, a \f$\texttt{size1}\times \texttt{dims}+1\f$ floating-point matrix.
Each row stores the point weight followed by the point coordinates. The matrix is allowed to have
a single column (weights only) if the user-defined cost matrix is used. The weights must be
non-negative and have at least one non-zero value.
@param signature2 Second signature of the same format as signature1 , though the number of rows
may be different. The total weights may be different. In this case an extra "dummy" point is added
to either signature1 or signature2. The weights must be non-negative and have at least one non-zero
value.
@param distType Used metric. See #DistanceTypes.
@param cost User-defined \f$\texttt{size1}\times \texttt{size2}\f$ cost matrix. Also, if a cost matrix
is used, lower boundary lowerBound cannot be calculated because it needs a metric function.
@param lowerBound Optional input/output parameter: lower boundary of a distance between the two
signatures that is a distance between mass centers. The lower boundary may not be calculated if
the user-defined cost matrix is used, the total weights of point configurations are not equal, or
if the signatures consist of weights only (the signature matrices have a single column). You
**must** initialize \*lowerBound . If the calculated distance between mass centers is greater or
equal to \*lowerBound (it means that the signatures are far enough), the function does not
calculate EMD. In any case \*lowerBound is set to the calculated distance between mass centers on
return. Thus, if you want to calculate both distance between mass centers and EMD, \*lowerBound
should be set to 0.
@param flow Resultant \f$\texttt{size1} \times \texttt{size2}\f$ flow matrix: \f$\texttt{flow}_{i,j}\f$ is

/** @brief Performs initial step of meanshift segmentation of an image.

The function implements the filtering stage of meanshift segmentation, that is, the output of the
function is the filtered "posterized" image with color gradients and fine-grain texture flattened.
At every pixel (X,Y) of the input image (or down-sized input image, see below) the function executes
meanshift iterations, that is, the pixel (X,Y) neighborhood in the joint space-color hyperspace is
considered:

\f[(x,y): X- \texttt{sp} \le x  \le X+ \texttt{sp} , Y- \texttt{sp} \le y  \le Y+ \texttt{sp} , ||(R,G,B)-(r,g,b)||   \le \texttt{sr}\f]

where (R,G,B) and (r,g,b) are the vectors of color components at (X,Y) and (x,y), respectively
(though, the algorithm does not depend on the color space used, so any 3-component color space can
be used instead). Over the neighborhood the average spatial value (X',Y') and average color vector
(R',G',B') are found and they act as the neighborhood center on the next iteration:

\f[(X,Y)~(X',Y'), (R,G,B)~(R',G',B').\f]

After the iterations over, the color components of the initial pixel (that is, the pixel from where
the iterations started) are set to the final value (average color at the last iteration):

\f[I(X,Y) <- (R*,G*,B*)\f]

When maxLevel \> 0, the gaussian pyramid of maxLevel+1 levels is built, and the above procedure is
run on the smallest layer first. After that, the results are propagated to the larger layer and the
iterations are run again only on those pixels where the layer colors differ by more than sr from the
lower-resolution layer of the pyramid. That makes boundaries of color regions sharper. Note that the
results will be actually different from the ones obtained by running the meanshift procedure on the
whole original image (i.e. when maxLevel==0).

/** @brief Calculates the distance to the closest zero pixel for each pixel of the source image.

The function cv::distanceTransform calculates the approximate or precise distance from every binary
image pixel to the nearest zero pixel. For zero image pixels, the distance will obviously be zero.

When maskSize == #DIST_MASK_PRECISE and distanceType == #DIST_L2 , the function runs the
algorithm described in @cite Felzenszwalb04 . This algorithm is parallelized with the TBB library.

In other cases, the algorithm @cite Borgefors86 is used. This means that for a pixel the function
finds the shortest path to the nearest zero pixel consisting of basic shifts: horizontal, vertical,
diagonal, or knight's move (the latest is available for a \f$5\times 5\f$ mask). The overall
distance is calculated as a sum of these basic distances. Since the distance function should be
symmetric, all of the horizontal and vertical shifts must have the same cost (denoted as a ), all
the diagonal shifts must have the same cost (denoted as `b`), and all knight's moves must have the
same cost (denoted as `c`). For the #DIST_C and #DIST_L1 types, the distance is calculated
precisely, whereas for #DIST_L2 (Euclidean distance) the distance can be calculated only with a
relative error (a \f$5\times 5\f$ mask gives more accurate results). For `a`,`b`, and `c`, OpenCV
uses the values suggested in the original paper:
- DIST_L1: `a = 1, b = 2`
- DIST_L2:
    - `3 x 3`: `a=0.955, b=1.3693`
    - `5 x 5`: `a=1, b=1.4, c=2.1969`
- DIST_C: `a = 1, b = 1`

Typically, for a fast, coarse distance estimation #DIST_L2, a \f$3\times 3\f$ mask is used. For a
more accurate distance estimation #DIST_L2, a \f$5\times 5\f$ mask or the precise algorithm is used.
Note that both the precise and the approximate algorithms are linear on the number of pixels.

This variant of the function does not only compute the minimum distance for each pixel \f$(x, y)\f$
but also identifies the nearest connected component consisting of zero pixels
(labelType==#DIST_LABEL_CCOMP) or the nearest zero pixel (labelType==#DIST_LABEL_PIXEL). Index of the
component/pixel is stored in `labels(x, y)`. When labelType==#DIST_LABEL_CCOMP, the function
automatically finds connected components of zero pixels in the input image and marks them with
distinct labels. When labelType==#DIST_LABEL_PIXEL, the function scans through the input image and
marks all the zero pixels with distinct labels.

In this mode, the complexity is still linear. That is, the function provides a very fast way to
compute the Voronoi diagram for a binary image. Currently, the second variant can use only the
approximate distance transform algorithm, i.e. maskSize=#DIST_MASK_PRECISE is not supported
yet.

/** @brief Fills a connected component with the given color.

- in case of a grayscale image and floating range
\f[\texttt{src} (x',y')- \texttt{loDiff} \leq \texttt{src} (x,y)  \leq \texttt{src} (x',y')+ \texttt{upDiff}\f]

- in case of a color image and floating range
\f[\texttt{src} (x',y')_r- \texttt{loDiff} _r \leq \texttt{src} (x,y)_r \leq \texttt{src} (x',y')_r+ \texttt{upDiff} _r,\f]
\f[\texttt{src} (x',y')_g- \texttt{loDiff} _g \leq \texttt{src} (x,y)_g \leq \texttt{src} (x',y')_g+ \texttt{upDiff} _g\f]
and
\f[\texttt{src} (x',y')_b- \texttt{loDiff} _b \leq \texttt{src} (x,y)_b \leq \texttt{src} (x',y')_b+ \texttt{upDiff} _b\f]


- in case of a color image and fixed range
\f[\texttt{src} ( \texttt{seedPoint} .x, \texttt{seedPoint} .y)_r- \texttt{loDiff} _r \leq \texttt{src} (x,y)_r \leq \texttt{src} ( \texttt{seedPoint} .x, \texttt{seedPoint} .y)_r+ \texttt{upDiff} _r,\f]

where \f$src(x',y')\f$ is the value of one of pixel neighbors that is already known to belong to the
component. That is, to be added to the connected component, a color/brightness of the pixel should
be close enough to:
- Color/brightness of one of its neighbors that already belong to the connected component in case
of a floating range.
- Color/brightness of the seed point in case of a fixed range.

Use these functions to either mark a connected component with the specified color in-place, or build
a mask and then extract the contour, or copy the region to another image, and so on.

@param image Input/output 1- or 3-channel, 8-bit, or floating-point image. It is modified by the
function unless the #FLOODFILL_MASK_ONLY flag is set in the second variant of the function. See
the details below.
@param mask Operation mask that should be a single-channel 8-bit image, 2 pixels wider and 2 pixels
taller than image. If an empty Mat is passed it will be created automatically. Since this is both an
input and output parameter, you must take responsibility of initializing it.
Flood-filling cannot go across non-zero pixels in the input mask. For example,
an edge detector output can be used as a mask to stop filling at edges. On output, pixels in the
mask corresponding to filled pixels in the image are set to 1 or to the specified value in flags
as described below. Additionally, the function fills the border of the mask with ones to simplify
internal processing. It is therefore possible to use the same mask in multiple calls to the function
to make sure the filled areas do not overlap.
@param seedPoint Starting point.
@param newVal New value of the repainted domain pixels.
@param loDiff Maximal lower brightness/color difference between the currently observed pixel and
one of its neighbors belonging to the component, or a seed pixel being added to the component.
@param upDiff Maximal upper brightness/color difference between the currently observed pixel and
one of its neighbors belonging to the component, or a seed pixel being added to the component.
@param rect Optional output parameter set by the function to the minimum bounding rectangle of the
repainted domain.
@param flags Operation flags. The first 8 bits contain a connectivity value. The default value of
4 means that only the four nearest neighbor pixels (those that share an edge) are considered. A
connectivity value of 8 means that the eight nearest neighbor pixels (those that share a corner)
will be considered. The next 8 bits (8-16) contain a value between 1 and 255 with which to fill
the mask (the default value is 1). For example, 4 | ( 255 \<\< 8 ) will consider 4 nearest
neighbours and fill the mask with a value of 255. The following additional options occupy higher
bits and therefore may be further combined with the connectivity and mask fill values using
bit-wise or (|), see #FloodFillFlags.

@note Since the mask is larger than the filled image, a pixel \f$(x, y)\f$ in image corresponds to the
pixel \f$(x+1, y+1)\f$ in the mask .

/** @brief Converts an image from one color space to another.

The function converts an input image from one color space to another. In case of a transformation
to-from RGB color space, the order of the channels should be specified explicitly (RGB or BGR). Note
that the default color format in OpenCV is often referred to as RGB but it is actually BGR (the
bytes are reversed). So the first byte in a standard (24-bit) color image will be an 8-bit Blue
component, the second byte will be Green, and the third byte will be Red. The fourth, fifth, and
sixth bytes would then be the second pixel (Blue, then Green, then Red), and so on.

The conventional ranges for R, G, and B channel values are:
-   0 to 255 for CV_8U images
-   0 to 65535 for CV_16U images
-   0 to 1 for CV_32F images

In case of linear transformations, the range does not matter. But in case of a non-linear
transformation, an input RGB image should be normalized to the proper value range to get the correct
results, for example, for RGB \f$\rightarrow\f$ L\*u\*v\* transformation. For example, if you have a
32-bit floating-point image directly converted from an 8-bit image without any scaling, then it will
have the 0..255 value range instead of 0..1 assumed by the function. So, before calling #cvtColor ,
you need first to scale the image down:
@code
    img *= 1./255;
    cvtColor(img, img, COLOR_BGR2Luv);
@endcode
If you use #cvtColor with 8-bit images, the conversion will have some information lost. For many
applications, this will not be noticeable but it is recommended to use 32-bit images in applications
that need the full range of colors or that convert an image before an operation and then convert
back.

If conversion adds the alpha channel, its value will set to the maximum of corresponding channel
range: 255 for CV_8U, 65535 for CV_16U, 1 for CV_32F.

@param src input image: 8-bit unsigned, 16-bit unsigned ( CV_16UC... ), or single-precision

/** @brief Compares a template against overlapped image regions.

The function slides through image , compares the overlapped patches of size \f$w \times h\f$ against
templ using the specified method and stores the comparison results in result . #TemplateMatchModes
describes the formulae for the available comparison methods ( \f$I\f$ denotes image, \f$T\f$
template, \f$R\f$ result, \f$M\f$ the optional mask ). The summation is done over template and/or
the image patch: \f$x' = 0...w-1, y' = 0...h-1\f$

After the function finishes the comparison, the best matches can be found as global minimums (when
#TM_SQDIFF was used) or maximums (when #TM_CCORR or #TM_CCOEFF was used) using the
#minMaxLoc function. In case of a color image, template summation in the numerator and each sum in
the denominator is done over all of the channels and separate mean values are used for each channel.
That is, the function can take a color template and a color image. The result will still be a
single-channel image, which is easier to analyze.

@param image Image where the search is running. It must be 8-bit or 32-bit floating-point.
@param templ Searched template. It must be not greater than the source image and have the same

            of the actual mask value (weight equals 1). For data type #CV_32F, the mask values are

 The function calculates the ellipse that fits a set of 2D points.
 It returns the rotated rectangle in which the ellipse is inscribed.
 The Approximate Mean Square (AMS) proposed by @cite Taubin1991 is used.

 For an ellipse, this basis set is \f$ \chi= \left(x^2, x y, y^2, x, y, 1\right) \f$,
 which is a set of six free coefficients \f$ A^T=\left\{A_{\text{xx}},A_{\text{xy}},A_{\text{yy}},A_x,A_y,A_0\right\} \f$.
 However, to specify an ellipse, all that is needed is five numbers; the major and minor axes lengths \f$ (a,b) \f$,
 the position \f$ (x_0,y_0) \f$, and the orientation \f$ \theta \f$. This is because the basis set includes lines,
 quadratics, parabolic and hyperbolic functions as well as elliptical functions as possible fits.
 If the fit is found to be a parabolic or hyperbolic function then the standard #fitEllipse method is used.
 The AMS method restricts the fit to parabolic, hyperbolic and elliptical curves
 by imposing the condition that \f$ A^T ( D_x^T D_x  +   D_y^T D_y) A = 1 \f$ where
 the matrices \f$ Dx \f$ and \f$ Dy \f$ are the partial derivatives of the design matrix \f$ D \f$ with
 respect to x and y. The matrices are formed row by row applying the following to
 each of the points in the set:
 \f{align*}{
 D(i,:)&=\left\{x_i^2, x_i y_i, y_i^2, x_i, y_i, 1\right\} &
 D_x(i,:)&=\left\{2 x_i,y_i,0,1,0,0\right\} &
 D_y(i,:)&=\left\{0,x_i,2 y_i,0,1,0\right\}

 quadratics, parabolic and hyperbolic functions as well as elliptical functions as possible fits.
 The Direct method confines the fit to ellipses by ensuring that \f$ 4 A_{xx} A_{yy}- A_{xy}^2 > 0 \f$.
 The condition imposed is that \f$ 4 A_{xx} A_{yy}- A_{xy}^2=1 \f$ which satisfies the inequality
 and as the coefficients can be arbitrarily scaled is not overly restrictive.

 \f{equation*}{

#ellipse2Poly and then render it with #polylines or fill it with #fillPoly. If you use the first
variant of the function and want to draw the whole ellipse, not an arc, pass `startAngle=0` and

thickness=#FILLED ), the contour interiors are drawn.
@param lineType Line connectivity. See #LineTypes
@param hierarchy Optional information about hierarchy. It is only needed if you want to draw only
some of the contours (see maxLevel ).
@param maxLevel Maximal level for drawn contours. If it is 0, only the specified contour is drawn.
If it is 1, the function draws the contour(s) and all the nested contours. If it is 2, the function
draws the contours, all the nested contours, all the nested-to-nested contours, and so on. This
parameter is only taken into account when there is hierarchy available.
@param offset Optional contour shift parameter. Shift all the drawn contours by the specified
\f$\texttt{offset}=(dx,dy)\f$ .
@note When thickness=#FILLED, the function is designed to handle connected components with holes correctly
even when no hierarchy data is provided. This is done by analyzing all the outlines together
using even-odd rule. This may give incorrect results if you have a joint collection of separately retrieved
contours. In order to solve this problem, you need to call #drawContours separately for each sub-group
