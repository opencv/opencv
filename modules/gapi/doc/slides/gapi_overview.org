* G-API: What is, why, what's for?

** OpenCV evolution in one slide

*** Version 1.x -- Library inception

- Just a set of CV functions + helpers around (visualization, IO);

*** Version 2.x -- Library rewrite

- OpenCV meets C++, ~cv::Mat~ replaces ~IplImage*~;

*** Version 3.0: -- Welcome Transparent API (T-API)

- ~cv::UMat~ is introduced as a /transparent/ addition to
  ~cv::Mat~;
- With ~cv::UMat~, an OpenCL kernel can be enqeueud instead of
  immediately running C code;
- ~cv::UMat~ data is kept on a /device/ until explicitly queried.

** OpenCV evolution in one slide (cont'd)
# FIXME: Learn proper page-breaking!

*** Version 4.0: -- Welcome Graph API (G-API)

- A new separate module (not a full library rewrite);
- A framework (or even a /meta/-framework);
- Usage model:
  - /Express/ an image/vision processing graph and then /execute/ it;
  - Fine-tune execution without changes in the graph;
- Similar to Halide -- separates logic from
  platform details.
- More than Halide:
  - Kernels can be written in unconstrained platform-native code;
  - Halide can serve as a backend (one of many).

** Why G-API?

*** Why introduce a new execution model?

- Ultimately it is all about optimizations;
  - or at least about a /possibility/ to optimize;
- A CV algorithm is usually not a single function call, but a
  composition of functions;
- Different models operate at different levels of knowledge on the
  algorithm (problem) we run.

** Why G-API? (cont'd)
# FIXME: Learn proper page-breaking!

*** Why introduce a new execution model?

- *Traditional* -- every function can be optimized (e.g. vectorized)
  and parallelized, the rest is up to programmer to care about.
- *Queue-based* -- kernels are enqueued dynamically with no guarantee
  where the end is or what is called next;
- *Graph-based* -- nearly all information is there, some compiler
  magic can be done!

** What is G-API for?

*** Bring the value of graph model with OpenCV where it makes sense:

- *Memory consumption* can be reduced dramatically;
- *Memory access* can be optimized to maximize cache reuse;
- *Parallelism* can be applied automatically where it is hard to do
  it manually;
  - It also becomes more efficient when working with graphs;
- *Heterogeneity* gets extra benefits like:
  - Avoiding unnecessary data transfers;
  - Shadowing transfer costs with parallel host co-execution;
  - Increasing system throughput with frame-level pipelining.

* Programming with G-API

** G-API Basics

*** G-API Concepts

- *Graphs* are built by applying /operations/ to /data objects/;
  - API itself has no "graphs", it is expression-based instead;
- *Data objects* do not hold actual data, only capture /dependencies/;
- *Operations* consume and produce data objects.
- A graph is defined by specifying its /boundaries/ with data objects:
  - What data objects are /inputs/ to the graph?
  - What are its /outputs/?

# FIXME: sections!!!

*** What we have just learned?

- G-API functions mimic their traditional OpenCV ancestors;
- No real data is required to construct a graph;
- Graph construction and graph execution are separate steps.

*** What else?

- Graph is first /expressed/ and then /captured/ in an object;
- Graph constructor defines /protocol/; user can pass vectors of
  inputs/outputs like
  #+BEGIN_SRC C++
cv::GComputation(cv::GIn(...), cv::GOut(...))
  #+END_SRC
- Calls to ~.apply()~ must conform to graph's protocol

** On data objects

Graph *protocol* defines what arguments a computation was defined on
  (both inputs and outputs), and what are the *shapes* (or types) of
  those arguments:

  | *Shape*     | *Argument*       | Size                        |
  |-------------+------------------+-----------------------------|
  | ~GMat~      | ~Mat~            | Static; defined during      |
  |             |                  | graph compilation           |
  |-------------+------------------+-----------------------------|
  | ~GScalar~   | ~Scalar~         | 4 x ~double~                |
  |-------------+------------------+-----------------------------|
  | ~GArray<T>~ | ~std::vector<T>~ | Dynamic; defined in runtime |

~GScalar~ may be value-initialized at construction time to allow
  expressions like ~GMat a = 2*(b + 1)~.

** Customization example

*** Tuning the execution

- Graph execution model is defined by kernels which are used;
- Kernels can be specified in graph compilation arguments:
  #+LaTeX: {\footnotesize
  #+BEGIN_SRC C++
  #include <opencv2/gapi/fluid/core.hpp>
  #include <opencv2/gapi/fluid/imgproc.hpp>
  ...
  auto pkg = gapi::combine(gapi::core::fluid::kernels(),
                           gapi::imgproc::fluid::kernels(),
                           cv::unite_policy::KEEP);
  sobel.apply(in_mat, out_mat, compile_args(pkg));
  #+END_SRC
  #+LaTeX: }
- OpenCL backend can be used in the same way;
  #+LaTeX: {\footnotesize
- *NOTE*: ~cv::unite_policy~ has been removed in OpenCV 4.1.1.
  #+LaTeX: }

** Operations and Kernels

*** Specifying a kernel package

- A *kernel* is an implementation of *operation* (= interface);
- A *kernel package* hosts kernels that G-API should use;
- Kernels are written for different *backends* and using their APIs;
- Two kernel packages can be *merged* into a single one;
- User can safely supply his *own kernels* to either /replace/ or
  /augment/ the default package.
  - Yes, even the standard kernels can be /overwritten/ by user from
    the outside!
- *Heterogeneous* kernel package hosts kernels of different backends.

** Operations and Kernels (cont'd)
# FIXME!!!

*** Defining an operation

- A type name (every operation is a C++ type);
- Operation signature (similar to ~std::function<>~);
- Operation identifier (a string);
- Metadata callback -- desribe what is the output value format(s),
  given the input and arguments.
- Use ~OpType::on(...)~ to use a new kernel ~OpType~ to construct graphs.
#+LaTeX: {\footnotesize
#+BEGIN_SRC C++
G_TYPED_KERNEL(GSqrt,<GMat(GMat)>,"org.opencv.core.math.sqrt") {
    static GMatDesc outMeta(GMatDesc in) { return in; }
};
#+END_SRC
#+LaTeX: }

** Operations and Kernels (cont'd)
# FIXME!!!

*** Implementing an operation

- Depends on the backend and its API;
- Common part for all backends: refer to operation being implemented
  using its /type/.

*** OpenCV backend
- OpenCV backend is the default one: OpenCV kernel is a wrapped OpenCV
  function:
  #+LaTeX: {\footnotesize
  #+BEGIN_SRC C++
  GAPI_OCV_KERNEL(GCPUSqrt, cv::gapi::core::GSqrt) {
      static void run(const cv::Mat& in, cv::Mat &out) {
          cv::sqrt(in, out);
      }
  };
  #+END_SRC
  #+LaTeX: }

** Operations and Kernels (cont'd)
# FIXME!!!

*** Fluid backend

- Fluid backend operates with row-by-row kernels and schedules its
  execution to optimize data locality:
  #+LaTeX: {\footnotesize
  #+BEGIN_SRC C++
  GAPI_FLUID_KERNEL(GFluidSqrt, cv::gapi::core::GSqrt, false) {
      static const int Window = 1;
      static void run(const View &in, Buffer &out) {
          hal::sqrt32f(in .InLine <float>(0)
                       out.OutLine<float>(0),
                       out.length());
      }
  };
  #+END_SRC
  #+LaTeX: }
- Note ~run~ changes signature but still is derived from the operation
  signature.

* Understanding the "G-Effect"

** Understanding the "G-Effect"

*** What is "G-Effect"?

- G-API is not only an API, but also an /implementation/;
  - i.e. it does some work already!
- We call "G-Effect" any measurable improvement which G-API demonstrates
  against traditional methods;
- So far the list is:
  - Memory consumption;
  - Performance;
  - Programmer efforts.

Note: in the following slides, all measurements are taken on
Intel\textregistered{} Core\texttrademark-i5 6600 CPU.

** Understanding the "G-Effect"
# FIXME

*** Memory consumption: Sobel Edge Detector

- G-API/Fluid backend is designed to minimize footprint:
#+LaTeX: {\footnotesize
| Input       | OpenCV | G-API/Fluid | Factor |
|             |    MiB |         MiB | Times  |
|-------------+--------+-------------+--------|
| 512 x 512   |  17.33 |        0.59 |  28.9x |
| 640 x 480   |  20.29 |        0.62 |  32.8x |
| 1280 x 720  |  60.73 |        0.72 |  83.9x |
| 1920 x 1080 | 136.53 |        0.83 | 164.7x |
| 3840 x 2160 | 545.88 |        1.22 | 447.4x |
#+LaTeX: }
- The detector itself can be written manually in two ~for~
  loops, but G-API covers cases more complex than that;
- OpenCV code requires changes to shrink footprint.

** Understanding the "G-Effect"

*** Performance: Sobel Edge Detector

- G-API/Fluid backend also optimizes cache reuse:

#+LaTeX: {\footnotesize
| Input       | OpenCV | G-API/Fluid | Factor |
|             |     ms |          ms |  Times |
|-------------+--------+-------------+--------|
| 320 x 240   |   1.16 |        0.53 |  2.17x |
| 640 x 480   |   5.66 |        1.89 |  2.99x |
| 1280 x 720  |  17.24 |        5.26 |  3.28x |
| 1920 x 1080 |  39.04 |       12.29 |  3.18x |
| 3840 x 2160 | 219.57 |       51.22 |  4.29x |
#+LaTeX: }

- The more data is processed, the bigger "G-Effect" is.

** Understanding the "G-Effect"

*** Relative speed-up based on cache efficiency

#+BEGIN_LATEX
\begin{figure}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{axis}[
      xlabel={Image size},
      ylabel={Relative speed-up},
      nodes near coords,
      width=0.8\textwidth,
      xtick=data,
      xticklabels={QVGA, VGA, HD, FHD, UHD},
      height=4.5cm,
    ]

    \addplot plot coordinates {(1, 1.0) (2, 1.38) (3, 1.51) (4, 1.46) (5, 1.97)};

    \end{axis}
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}
#+END_LATEX

The higher resolution is, the higher relative speed-up is (with
speed-up on QVGA taken as 1.0).
