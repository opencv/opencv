    @param nfeatures The maximum number of features to retain.
    @param scaleFactor Pyramid decimation ratio, greater than 1. scaleFactor==2 means the classical
    pyramid, where each next level has 4x less pixels than the previous, but such a big scale factor
    will degrade feature matching scores dramatically. On the other hand, too close to 1 scale factor
    will mean that to cover certain scale range you will need more pyramid levels and so the speed
    will suffer.
    @param nlevels The number of pyramid levels. The smallest level will have linear size equal to
    input_image_linear_size/pow(scaleFactor, nlevels - firstLevel).
    @param edgeThreshold This is size of the border where the features are not detected. It should
    roughly match the patchSize parameter.
    @param firstLevel The level of pyramid to put source image to. Previous layers are filled
    with upscaled source image.
    @param WTA_K The number of points that produce each element of the oriented BRIEF descriptor. The
    default value 2 means the BRIEF where we take a random point pair and compare their brightnesses,
    so we get 0/1 response. Other possible values are 3 and 4. For example, 3 means that we take 3
    random points (of course, those point coordinates are random, but they are generated from the
    pre-defined seed, so each element of BRIEF descriptor is computed deterministically from the pixel
    rectangle), find point of maximum brightness and output index of the winner (0, 1 or 2). Such
    output will occupy 2 bits, and therefore it will need a special variant of Hamming distance,
    denoted as NORM_HAMMING2 (2 bits per bin). When WTA_K=4, we take 4 random points to compute each
    bin (that will also occupy 2 bits with possible values 0, 1, 2 or 3).
    @param scoreType The default HARRIS_SCORE means that Harris algorithm is used to rank features
    (the score is written to KeyPoint::score and is used to retain best nfeatures features);
    FAST_SCORE is alternative value of the parameter that produces slightly less stable keypoints,
    but it is a little faster to compute.
    @param patchSize size of the patch used by the oriented BRIEF descriptor. Of course, on smaller
    pyramid layers the perceived image area covered by a feature will be larger.

/** @brief Class for extracting blobs from an image. :

The class implements a simple algorithm for extracting blobs from an image:

1.  Convert the source image to binary images by applying thresholding with several thresholds from
    minThreshold (inclusive) to maxThreshold (exclusive) with distance thresholdStep between
    neighboring thresholds.
2.  Extract connected components from every binary image by findContours and calculate their
    centers.
3.  Group centers from several binary images by their coordinates. Close centers form one group that
    corresponds to one blob, which is controlled by the minDistBetweenBlobs parameter.
4.  From the groups, estimate final centers of blobs and their radiuses and return as locations and
    sizes of keypoints.

This class performs several filtrations of returned blobs. You should set filterBy\* to true/false
to turn on/off corresponding filtration. Available filtrations:

-   **By color**. This filter compares the intensity of a binary image at the center of a blob to
blobColor. If they differ, the blob is filtered out. Use blobColor = 0 to extract dark blobs
and blobColor = 255 to extract light blobs.
-   **By area**. Extracted blobs have an area between minArea (inclusive) and maxArea (exclusive).
-   **By circularity**. Extracted blobs have circularity
(\f$\frac{4*\pi*Area}{perimeter * perimeter}\f$) between minCircularity (inclusive) and
maxCircularity (exclusive).
-   **By ratio of the minimum inertia to maximum inertia**. Extracted blobs have this ratio
between minInertiaRatio (inclusive) and maxInertiaRatio (exclusive).
-   **By convexity**. Extracted blobs have convexity (area / area of blob convex hull) between
minConvexity (inclusive) and maxConvexity (exclusive).

Default values of parameters are tuned to extract dark circular blobs.
