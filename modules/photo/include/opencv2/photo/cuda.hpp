@param src Input 8-bit 1-channel, 2-channel or 3-channel image.
@param dst Output image with the same size and type as src .
@param h Parameter regulating filter strength. Big h value perfectly removes noise but also
removes image details, smaller h value preserves details but also preserves some noise
@param search_window Size in pixels of the window that is used to compute weighted average for
given pixel. Should be odd. Affect performance linearly: greater search_window - greater
denoising time. Recommended value 21 pixels
@param block_size Size in pixels of the template patch that is used to compute weights. Should be
odd. Recommended value 7 pixels
