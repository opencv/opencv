/** @brief Primal-dual algorithm is an algorithm for solving special types of variational problems (that is,
finding a function to minimize some functional). As the image denoising, in particular, may be seen
as the variational problem, primal-dual algorithm then can be used to perform denoising and this is
exactly what is implemented.

It should be noted, that this implementation was taken from the July 2013 blog entry
@cite MA13 , which also contained (slightly more general) ready-to-use source code on Python.
Subsequently, that code was rewritten on C++ with the usage of openCV by Vadim Pisarevsky at the end
of July 2013 and finally it was slightly adapted by later authors.

Although the thorough discussion and justification of the algorithm involved may be found in
@cite ChambolleEtAl, it might make sense to skim over it here, following @cite MA13 . To begin
with, we consider the 1-byte gray-level images as the functions from the rectangular domain of
pixels (it may be seen as set
\f$\left\{(x,y)\in\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}\mid 1\leq x\leq n,\;1\leq y\leq m\right\}\f$ for some
\f$m,\;n\in\mathbb{N}\f$) into \f$\{0,1,\dots,255\}\f$. We shall denote the noised images as \f$f_i\f$ and with
this view, given some image \f$x\f$ of the same size, we may measure how bad it is by the formula

\f[\left\|\left\|\nabla x\right\|\right\| + \lambda\sum_i\left\|\left\|x-f_i\right\|\right\|\f]

\f$\|\|\cdot\|\|\f$ here denotes \f$L_2\f$-norm and as you see, the first addend states that we want our
image to be smooth (ideally, having zero gradient, thus being constant) and the second states that
we want our result to be close to the observations we've got. If we treat \f$x\f$ as a function, this is
exactly the functional what we seek to minimize and here the Primal-Dual algorithm comes into play.

@param observations This array should contain one or more noised versions of the image that is to
be restored.
@param result Here the denoised image will be stored. There is no need to do pre-allocation of
storage space, as it will be automatically allocated, if necessary.
@param lambda Corresponds to \f$\lambda\f$ in the formulas above. As it is enlarged, the smooth
(blurred) images are treated more favorably than detailed (but maybe more noised) ones. Roughly
speaking, as it becomes smaller, the result will be more blur but more sever outliers will be
removed.
@param niters Number of iterations that the algorithm will run. Of course, as more iterations as
better, but it is hard to quantitatively refine this statement, so just use the default and
increase it if the results are poor.
