# This script extracts several properties and then writes them to a
# to a file, 'build.properties'. These properties include:
#
#	1. OpenCV version.
#	2. OpenCV version as a string for use by Maven.
#	3. The CPU binary word size.
#	4. Architecture string.
#	4. OSGi compatible CPU architecture string.
#
# There is no need to execute this script directly as it will be
# called during the Maven build process.
#
# Command-line parameters:
#   $1 - The build directory and where the output file will be written
#   $2 - The name of the output file to write to.
#
# Returns:
#   0 - Successfully written the properties file.
#   1 - Error occurred such as build directory does not exist
#	or OpenCV version could not be determined or an
#	unexpected error.
