PR Title: Fix LINE_4/LINE_8 swapped behavior in drawing functions

Branch: fix/drawcontours-line-type-swap-26413
Issue: #26413

===== DESCRIPTION =====

Summary
Fixes swapped LINE_4 and LINE_8 connectivity behavior in drawContours(), polylines(), and related drawing functions.

Problem
When using cv::drawContours() and related functions:
- LINE_4 (4-connected) produced 8-connected lines
- LINE_8 (8-connected) produced 4-connected lines

This affected all drawing functions using ThickLine() internally.

Root Cause
In modules/imgproc/src/drawing.cpp line 1670, incorrect routing condition:

if( line_type == 1 || line_type == 4 || shift == 0 )
    Line( img, p0, p1, color, line_type );
else
    Line2( img, p0, p1, color );

This caused:
- LINE_4 (value 4) matched condition and was routed to Line() which implemented 8-connectivity behavior
- LINE_8 (value 8) fell through to Line2() which implements 4-connectivity

Solution
Changed condition from line_type == 4 to line_type == 8:

if( line_type == 1 || line_type == 8 || shift == 0 )
    Line( img, p0, p1, color, line_type );
else
    Line2( img, p0, p1, color );

Now:
- LINE_8 (value 8) correctly calls Line() with 8-connectivity
- LINE_4 (value 4) correctly calls Line2() with 4-connectivity

Changes
modules/imgproc/src/drawing.cpp line 1670: Changed line_type == 4 to line_type == 8

Impact
- LINE_4 now correctly produces 4-connected lines (horizontal/vertical steps only)
- LINE_8 now correctly produces 8-connected lines (including diagonals)
- Matches documented LineTypes enum behavior and user expectations

Testing
Verified with test code from issue #26413 showing convex hull drawing with different line types produces correct connectivity.
