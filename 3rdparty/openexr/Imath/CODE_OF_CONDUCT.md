# Code of Conduct

Imath is a sub-project of the OpenEXR project, which abides by Linux
Foundation's code of conduct, which you can read in full
[here](https://lfprojects.org/policies/code-of-conduct).

Our covenant includes:

* Treat each other with respect, professionalism, fairness, and
  sensitivity to our many differences and strengths, including in
  situations of high pressure and urgency.

* Never harass or bully anyone verbally, physically or sexually.

* Never discriminate on the basis of personal characteristics or group
  membership.

* Communicate constructively and avoid demeaning or insulting behavior
  or language.

* Seek, accept, and offer objective work criticism, and acknowledge
  properly the contributions of others.

* Be honest about your own qualifications, and about any circumstances
  that might lead to conflicts of interest.

* Respect the privacy of others and the confidentiality of data you
  access.

* With respect to cultural differences, be conservative in what you do
  and liberal in what you accept from others, but not to the point of
  accepting disrespectful, unprofessional or unfair or unwelcome
  behavior or advances.

* Promote the rules of this Code and take action (especially if you
  are in a leadership position) to bring the discussion back to a more
  civil level whenever inappropriate behaviors are observed.

* Stay on topic: Make sure that you are posting to the correct channel
  and avoid off-topic discussions. Remember when you update an issue
  or respond to an email you are potentially sending to a large number
  of people.

* Step down considerately: participants in every project come and go,
  and LF Projects is no different. When you leave or disengage from
  the project, in whole or in part, we ask that you do so in a way
  that minimizes disruption to the project. This means you should tell
  people you are leaving and take the proper steps to ensure that
  others can pick up where you left off.

To report incidents or to appeal reports of incidents, send email to
the Manager of LF Projects at manager@lfprojects.org.
