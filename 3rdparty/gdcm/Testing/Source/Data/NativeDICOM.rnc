# PS 3.19-2011
# A.1.6          Schema
# The Normative version of the XML Schema for the Native DICOM Model follows:
default namespace="http://dicom.nema.org/PS3.19/models/NativeDICOM"

# This schema was created as an intermediary, a means of describing
# native binary encoded DICOM objects as XML Infosets, thus allowing
# one to manipulate binary DICOM objects using familiar XML tools.
# As such, the schema is designed to facilitate a simple, mechanical,
# bi-directional translation between binary encoded DICOM and XML-like
# constructs without constraints, and to simplify identifying portions
# of a DICOM object using XPath statements.
#
# Since this schema has minimal type checking, it is neither intended
# to be used for any operation that involves hand coding, nor to
# describe a definitive, fully validating encoding of DICOM concepts
# into XML, as what one might use, for example, in a robust XML
# database system or in XML-based forms, though it may be used
# as a means for translating binary DICOM Objects into such a form
# (e.g. through an XSLT script).

start = element NativeDicomModel { DicomDataSet }

# A DICOM Data Set is as defined in PS3.5. It does not appear
# as an XML Element, since it does not appear in the binary encoded
# DICOM objects. It exists here merely as a documentation aid.
