/*
 * IMAGE DATA FORMATS:
 *
 * The standard input image format is a rectangular array of pixels, with
 * each pixel having the same number of "component" values (color channels).
 * Each pixel row is an array of JSAMPLEs (which typically are unsigned chars).
 * If you are working with color data, then the color values for each pixel
 * must be adjacent in the row; for example, R,G,B,R,G,B,R,G,B,... for 24-bit
 * RGB color.
 *
 * For this example, we'll assume that this data structure matches the way
 * our application has stored the image in memory, so we can just pass a
 * pointer to our image buffer.  In particular, let's say that the image is
 * RGB color and is described by:

/*
 * SOME FINE POINTS:
 *
 * In the above loop, we ignored the return value of jpeg_write_scanlines,

 * with this because we were only relying on the value of cinfo.next_scanline,
 * which will be incremented correctly.  If you maintain additional loop
 * variables then you should be careful to increment them properly.
 * Actually, for output to a stdio stream you needn't worry, because
 * then jpeg_write_scanlines will write all the lines passed (or else exit
 * with a fatal error).  Partial writes can only occur if you use a data
 * destination module that can demand suspension of the compressor.
 * (If you don't know what that's for, you don't need it.)
 *
 * If the compressor requires full-image buffers (for entropy-coding
 * optimization or a multi-scan JPEG file), it will create temporary
 * files for anything that doesn't fit within the maximum-memory setting.
 * (Note that temp files are NOT needed if you use the default parameters.)
 * On some systems you may need to set up a signal handler to ensure that
 * temporary files are deleted if the program is interrupted.  See libjpeg.doc.
 *
 * Scanlines MUST be supplied in top-to-bottom order if you want your JPEG
 * files to be compatible with everyone else's.  If you cannot readily read
 * your data in that order, you'll need an intermediate array to hold the
 * image.  See rdtarga.c or rdbmp.c for examples of handling bottom-to-top
 * source data using the JPEG code's internal virtual-array mechanisms.

/******************** JPEG DECOMPRESSION SAMPLE INTERFACE *******************/

/* This half of the example shows how to read data from the JPEG decompressor.
 * It's a bit more refined than the above, in that we show:
 *   (a) how to modify the JPEG library's standard error-reporting behavior;
 *   (b) how to allocate workspace using the library's memory manager.
 *
 * Just to make this example a little different from the first one, we'll
 * assume that we do not intend to put the whole image into an in-memory
 * buffer, but to send it line-by-line someplace else.  We need a one-
 * scanline-high JSAMPLE array as a work buffer, and we will let the JPEG
 * memory manager allocate it for us.  This approach is actually quite useful
 * because we don't need to remember to deallocate the buffer separately: it
 * will go away automatically when the JPEG object is cleaned up.
 */


/*
 * ERROR HANDLING:
 *
 * The JPEG library's standard error handler (jerror.c) is divided into
 * several "methods" which you can override individually.  This lets you
 * adjust the behavior without duplicating a lot of code, which you might
 * have to update with each future release.
 *
 * Our example here shows how to override the "error_exit" method so that
 * control is returned to the library's caller when a fatal error occurs,
 * rather than calling exit() as the standard error_exit method does.
 *
 * We use C's setjmp/longjmp facility to return control.  This means that the
 * routine which calls the JPEG library must first execute a setjmp() call to
 * establish the return point.  We want the replacement error_exit to do a
 * longjmp().  But we need to make the setjmp buffer accessible to the
 * error_exit routine.  To do this, we make a private extension of the
 * standard JPEG error handler object.  (If we were using C++, we'd say we
 * were making a subclass of the regular error handler.)
 *
 * Here's the extended error handler struct:
 */
