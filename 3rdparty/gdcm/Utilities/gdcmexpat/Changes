Release 2.0.0 Wed Jan 11 2006
        - We no longer use the "check" library for C unit testing; we
          always use the (partial) internal implementation of the API.
        - Report XML_NS setting via XML_GetFeatureList().
        - Fixed headers for use from C++.
        - XML_GetCurrentLineNumber() and  XML_GetCurrentColumnNumber()
          now return unsigned integers.
        - Added XML_LARGE_SIZE switch to enable 64-bit integers for
          byte indexes and line/column numbers.
        - Updated to use libtool 1.5.22 (the most recent).
        - Added support for AmigaOS.
        - Some mostly minor bug fixes. SF issues include: 1006708,
          1021776, 1023646, 1114960, 1156398, 1221160, 1271642.

Release 1.95.8 Fri Jul 23 2004
        - Major new feature: suspend/resume.  Handlers can now request
          that a parse be suspended for later resumption or aborted
          altogether.  See "Temporarily Stopping Parsing" in the
          documentation for more details.
        - Some mostly minor bug fixes, but compilation should no
          longer generate warnings on most platforms.  SF issues
          include: 827319, 840173, 846309, 888329, 896188, 923913,
          928113, 961698, 985192.

Release 1.95.7 Mon Oct 20 2003
        - Fixed enum XML_Status issue (reported on SourceForge many
          times), so compilers that are properly picky will be happy.
        - Introduced an XMLCALL macro to control the calling
          convention used by the Expat API; this macro should be used
          to annotate prototypes and definitions of callback
          implementations in code compiled with a calling convention
          other than the default convention for the host platform.
        - Improved ability to build without the configure-generated
          expat_config.h header.  This is useful for applications
          which embed Expat rather than linking in the library.
        - Fixed a variety of bugs: see SF issues 458907, 609603,
          676844, 679754, 692878, 692964, 695401, 699323, 699487,
          820946.
        - Improved hash table lookups.
        - Added more regression tests and improved documentation.

Release 1.95.6 Tue Jan 28 2003
        - Added XML_FreeContentModel().
        - Added XML_MemMalloc(), XML_MemRealloc(), XML_MemFree().
        - Fixed a variety of bugs: see SF issues 615606, 616863,
          618199, 653180, 673791.
        - Enhanced the regression test suite.
        - Man page improvements: includes SF issue 632146.

Release 1.95.5 Fri Sep 6 2002
        - Added XML_UseForeignDTD() for improved SAX2 support.
        - Added XML_GetFeatureList().
        - Defined XML_Bool type and the values XML_TRUE and XML_FALSE.
        - Use an incomplete struct instead of a void* for the parser
          (may not retain).
        - Fixed UTF-8 decoding bug that caused legal UTF-8 to be rejected.
        - Finally fixed bug where default handler would report DTD
          events that were already handled by another handler.
          Initial patch contributed by Darryl Miles.
        - Removed unnecessary DllMain() function that caused static
          linking into a DLL to be difficult.
        - Added VC++ projects for building static libraries.
        - Reduced line-length for all source code and headers to be
          no longer than 80 characters, to help with AS/400 support.
        - Reduced memory copying during parsing (SF patch #600964).
        - Fixed a variety of bugs: see SF issues 580793, 434664,
          483514, 580503, 581069, 584041, 584183, 584832, 585537,
          596555, 596678, 598352, 598944, 599715, 600479, 600971.

Release 1.95.4 Fri Jul 12 2002
        - Added support for VMS, contributed by Craig Berry.  See
          vms/README.vms for more information.
        - Added Mac OS (classic) support, with a makefile for MPW,
          contributed by Thomas Wegner and Daryle Walker.
        - Added Borland C++ Builder 5 / BCC 5.5 support, contributed
          by Patrick McConnell (SF patch #538032).
        - Fixed a variety of bugs: see SF issues 441449, 563184,
          564342, 566334, 566901, 569461, 570263, 575168, 579196.
        - Made skippedEntityHandler conform to SAX2 (see source comment)
        - Re-implemented WFC: Entity Declared from XML 1.0 spec and
          added a new error "entity declared in parameter entity":
          see SF bug report 569461 and SF patch 578161
        - Re-implemented section 5.1 from XML 1.0 spec:
          see SF bug report 570263 and SF patch 578161

Release 1.95.3 Mon Jun 3 2002
        - Added a project to the MSVC workspace to create a wchar_t
          version of the library; the DLLs are named libexpatw.dll.
        - Changed the name of the Windows DLLs from expat.dll to
          libexpat.dll; this fixes SF bug #432456.
        - Added the XML_ParserReset() API function.
        - Fixed XML_SetReturnNSTriplet() to work for element names.
        - Made the XML_UNICODE builds usable (thanks, Karl!).
        - Allow xmlwf to read from standard input.
        - Install a man page for xmlwf on Unix systems.
        - Fixed many bugs; see SF bug reports 231864, 461380, 464837,
          466885, 469226, 477667, 484419, 487840, 494749, 496505,
          547350.  Other bugs which we can't test as easily may also
          have been fixed, especially in the area of build support.

Release 1.95.2 Fri Jul 27 2001
        - More changes to make MSVC happy with the build; add a single
          workspace to support both the library and xmlwf application.
        - Added a Windows installer for Windows users; includes
          xmlwf.exe.
        - Added compile-time constants that can be used to determine the
          Expat version
        - Removed a lot of GNU-specific dependencies to aide portability
          among the various Unix flavors.
        - Fix the UTF-8 BOM bug.
        - Cleaned up warning messages for several compilers.
        - Added the -Wall, -Wstrict-prototypes options for GCC.

Release 1.95.1 Sun Oct 22 15:11:36 EDT 2000
        - Changes to get expat to build under Microsoft compiler
        - Removed all aborts and instead return an UNEXPECTED_STATE error.
        - Fixed a bug where a stray '%' in an entity value would cause an
          abort.
        - Defined XML_SetEndNamespaceDeclHandler. Thanks to Darryl Miles for
          finding this oversight.
        - Changed default patterns in lib/Makefile.in to fit non-GNU makes
          Thanks to robin@unrated.net for reporting and providing an
          account to test on.
        - The reference had the wrong label for XML_SetStartNamespaceDecl.
          Reported by an anonymous user.

Release 1.95.0 Fri Sep 29 2000
        - XML_ParserCreate_MM
                Allows you to set a memory management suite to replace the
                standard malloc,realloc, and free.
        - XML_SetReturnNSTriplet
                If you turn this feature on when namespace processing is in
                effect, then qualified, prefixed element and attribute names
                are returned as "uri|name|prefix" where '|' is whatever
                separator character is used in namespace processing.
        - Merged in features from perl-expat
                o XML_SetElementDeclHandler
                o XML_SetAttlistDeclHandler
                o XML_SetXmlDeclHandler
                o XML_SetEntityDeclHandler
                o StartDoctypeDeclHandler takes 3 additional parameters:
                        sysid, pubid, has_internal_subset
                o Many paired handler setters (like XML_SetElementHandler)
                  now have corresponding individual handler setters
                o XML_GetInputContext for getting the input context of
                  the current parse position.
        - Added reference material
        - Packaged into a distribution that builds a sharable library
