   Use the real python debugging library if it is provided.
   Otherwise use the "documented" trick involving checking for _DEBUG
   and undefined that symbol while we include Python headers.
   Update: this method does not fool Microsoft Visual C++ 8 anymore; two
   of its header files (crtdefs.h and use_ansi.h) check if _DEBUG was set
   or not, and set flags accordingly (_CRT_MANIFEST_RETAIL,
   _CRT_MANIFEST_DEBUG, _CRT_MANIFEST_INCONSISTENT). The next time the
   check is performed in the same compilation unit, and the flags are found,
   and error is triggered. Let's prevent that by setting _CRT_NOFORCE_MANIFEST.
