Attribute Name Tag Type Attribute Description
File Preamble No Tag
or Length
Fields
1 A fixed 128 byte field available for Application Profile or
implementation specified use. If not used by an Application
Profile or a specific implementation all bytes shall be set to
00H.
File-set Readers or Updaters shall not rely on the content of
this Preamble to determine that this File is or is not a
DICOM File.
DICOM Prefix No Tag
or Length
Fields
1 Four bytes containing the character string "DICM". This
Prefix is intended to be used to recognize that this File is or
not a DICOM File.
Group Length (0002,0000) 1 Number of bytes following this File Meta Element (end of
the Value field) up to and including the last File Meta
Element of the Group 2 File Meta Information
File Meta
Information
Version
(0002,0001) 1 This is a two byte field where each bit identifies a version of
this File Meta Information header. In version 1 the first byte
value is 00H and the second value byte value is 01H.
Implementations reading Files with Meta Information where
this attribute has bit 0 (lsb) of the second byte set to 1 may
interpret the File Meta Information as specified in this
version of PS 3.10. All other bits shall not be checked.
Note: A bit field where each bit identifies a version, allows
explicit indication of the support of multiple previous
versions. Future versions of the File Meta Information
that can be read by verson 1 readers will have bit 0 of
the second byte set to 1
Media Storage
SOP Class UID
(0002,0002) 1 Uniquely identifies the SOP Class associated with the Data
Set. SOP Class UIDs allowed for media storage are
specified in PS 3.4 of the DICOM Standard - Media Storage
Application Profiles.
Media Storage
SOP Instance UID
(0002,0003) 1 Uniquely identifies the SOP Instance associated with the
Data Set placed in the file and following the File Meta
Information.
Transfer Syntax
UID
(0002,0010) 1 Uniquely identifies the Transfer Syntax used to encode the
following Data Set. This Transfer Syntax does not apply to
the File Meta Information.
Note: It is recommended to use one of the DICOM Transfer
Syntaxes supporting explicit Value Representation
encoding to facilitate interpretation of File Meta
Element Values. JPIP Referenced Pixel Data Transfer
Syntaxes are not used. (See PS 3.5 of the DICOM
Standard).
Implementation
Class UID
(0002,0012) 1 Uniquely identifies the implementation which wrote this file
and its content. It provides an unambiguous identification
of the type of implementation which last wrote the file in the
event of interchange problems. It follows the same policies
as defined by PS 3.7 of the DICOM Standard (association
negotiation).
Implementation
Version Name
(0002,0013) 3 Identifies a version for an Implementation Class UID
(0002,0012) using up to 16 characters of the repertoire
identified in Section 8.5. It follows the same policies as
defined by PS 3.7 of the DICOM Standard (association

negotiation).
Source Application
Entity Title
(0002,0016) 3 The DICOM Application Entity (AE) Title of the AE which
wrote this file's content (or last updated it). If used, it allows
the tracing of the source of errors in the event of media
interchange problems. The policies associated with AE
Titles are the same as those defined in PS 3.8 of the
DICOM Standard.
Private Information
Creator UID
(0002,0100) 3 The UID of the creator of the private information
(0002,0102).
Private Information (0002,0102) 1C Contains Private Information placed in the File Meta
Information. The creator shall be identified in (0002,0100).
Required if Private Information Creator UID (0002,0100) is
present.
