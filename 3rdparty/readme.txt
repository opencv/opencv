This folder contains libraries and headers of a few very popular still image codecs
used by imgcodecs module.
The libraries and headers are preferably to build Win32 and Win64 versions of OpenCV.
On UNIX systems all the libraries are automatically detected by configure script.
In order to use these versions of libraries instead of system ones on UNIX systems you
should use BUILD_<library_name> CMake flags (for example, BUILD_PNG for the libpng library).

jasper                JasPer is a collection of software
                      (i.e., a library and application programs) for the coding
                      and manipulation of images.  This software can handle image data in a
                      variety of formats.  One such format supported by JasPer is the JPEG-2000
                      format defined in ISO/IEC 15444-1.
