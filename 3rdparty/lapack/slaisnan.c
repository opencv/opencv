/*     .. Scalar Arguments .. */
/*     .. */

/*  Purpose */
/*  ======= */

/*  This routine is not for general use.  It exists solely to avoid */
/*  over-optimization in SISNAN. */

/*  SLAISNAN checks for NaNs by comparing its two arguments for */
/*  inequality.  NaN is the only floating-point value where NaN != NaN */
/*  returns .TRUE.  To check for NaNs, pass the same variable as both */
/*  arguments. */

/*  A compiler must assume that the two arguments are */
/*  not the same variable, and the test will not be optimized away. */
/*  Interprocedural or whole-program optimization may delete this */
/*  test.  The ISNAN functions will be replaced by the correct */
/*  Fortran 03 intrinsic once the intrinsic is widely available. */

/*  Arguments */
/*  ========= */

/*  SIN1     (input) REAL */
/*  SIN2     (input) REAL */
/*          Two numbers to compare for inequality. */
