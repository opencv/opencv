Version 0.81 [August, 1995]
  incorporated Tim Wegner's medium model code (thanks, Tim)

Version 0.82 [September, 1995]
  [unspecified changes]

Version 0.85 [December, 1995]
  added more medium model code (almost everything's a far)
  added i/o, error, and memory callback functions
  fixed some bugs (16-bit, 4-bit interlaced, etc.)
  added first run progressive reader (barely tested)

Version 0.86 [January, 1996]
  fixed bugs
  improved documentation

Version 0.87 [January, 1996]
  fixed medium model bugs
  fixed other bugs introduced in 0.85 and 0.86
  added some minor documentation

Version 0.88 [January, 1996]
  fixed progressive bugs
  replaced tabs with spaces
  cleaned up documentation
  added callbacks for read/write and warning/error functions

Version 0.89 [July, 1996]
  Added new initialization API to make libpng work better with shared libs
    we now have png_create_read_struct(), png_create_write_struct(),
    png_create_info_struct(), png_destroy_read_struct(), and
    png_destroy_write_struct() instead of the separate calls to
    malloc and png_read_init(), png_info_init(), and png_write_init()
  Changed warning/error callback functions to fix bug - this means you
    should use the new initialization API if you were using the old
    png_set_message_fn() calls, and that the old API no longer exists
    so that people are aware that they need to change their code
  Changed filter selection API to allow selection of multiple filters
    since it didn't work in previous versions of libpng anyways
  Optimized filter selection code
  Fixed png_set_background() to allow using an arbitrary RGB color for
    paletted images
  Fixed gamma and background correction for paletted images, so
    png_correct_palette is not needed unless you are correcting an
    external palette (you will need to #define PNG_CORRECT_PALETTE_SUPPORTED
    in pngconf.h) - if nobody uses this, it may disappear in the future.
  Fixed bug with Borland 64K memory allocation (Alexander Lehmann)
  Fixed bug in interlace handling (Smarasderagd, I think)
  Added more error checking for writing and image to reduce invalid files
  Separated read and write functions so that they won't both be linked
    into a binary when only reading or writing functionality is used
  New pngtest image also has interlacing and zTXt
  Updated documentation to reflect new API

Version 0.90 [January, 1997]
  Made CRC errors/warnings on critical and ancillary chunks configurable
  libpng will use the zlib CRC routines by (compile-time) default
  Changed DOS small/medium model memory support - needs zlib 1.04 (Tim Wegner)
  Added external C++ wrapper statements to png.h (Gilles Dauphin)
  Allow PNG file to be read when some or all of file signature has already
    been read from the beginning of the stream.  ****This affects the size
    of info_struct and invalidates all programs that use a shared libpng****
  Fixed png_filler() declarations
  Fixed? background color conversions
  Fixed order of error function pointers to match documentation
  Current chunk name is now available in png_struct to reduce the number
    of nearly identical error messages (will simplify multi-lingual
    support when available)
  Try to get ready for unknown-chunk callback functions:
    - previously read critical chunks are flagged, so the chunk handling
      routines can determine if the chunk is in the right place
    - all chunk handling routines have the same prototypes, so we will
      be able to handle all chunks via a callback mechanism
  Try to fix Linux "setjmp" buffer size problems
  Removed png_large_malloc, png_large_free, and png_realloc functions.

Version 0.95 [March, 1997]
  Fixed bug in pngwutil.c allocating "up_row" twice and "avg_row" never
  Fixed bug in PNG file signature compares when start != 0
  Changed parameter type of png_set_filler(...filler...) from png_byte
    to png_uint_32
  Added test for MACOS to ensure that both math.h and fp.h are not #included
  Added macros for libpng to be compiled as a Windows DLL (Andreas Kupries)
  Added "packswap" transformation, which changes the endianness of
    packed-pixel bytes (Kevin Bracey)
  Added "strip_alpha" transformation, which removes the alpha channel of
    input images without using it (not necessarily a good idea)
  Added "swap_alpha" transformation, which puts the alpha channel in front
    of the color bytes instead of after
  Removed all implicit variable tests which assume NULL == 0 (I think)
  Changed several variables to "png_size_t" to show 16/32-bit limitations
  Added new pCAL chunk read/write support
  Added experimental filter selection weighting (Greg Roelofs)
  Removed old png_set_rgbx() and png_set_xrgb() functions that have been
     obsolete for about 2 years now (use png_set_filler() instead)
  Added macros to read 16- and 32-bit ints directly from buffer, to be
    used only on those systems that support it (namely PowerPC and 680x0)
    With some testing, this may become the default for MACOS/PPC systems.
  Only calculate CRC on data if we are going to use it
  Added macros for zTXt compression type PNG_zTXt_COMPRESSION_???
  Added macros for simple libpng debugging output selectable at compile time
  Removed PNG_READ_END_MODE in progressive reader (Smarasderagd)
  More description of info_struct in libpng.txt and png.h
  More instructions in example.c
  More chunk types tested in pngtest.c
  Renamed pngrcb.c to pngset.c, and all png_read_<chunk> functions to be
    png_set_<chunk>.  We now have corresponding png_get_<chunk>
    functions in pngget.c to get information in info_ptr.  This isolates
    the application from the internal organization of png_info_struct
    (good for shared library implementations).

  Minor corrections in libpng.txt
  Added simple sRGB support (Glenn R-P)
  Easier conditional compiling, e.g.,
    define PNG_READ/WRITE_NOT_FULLY_SUPPORTED;
    all configurable options can be selected from command-line instead
    of having to edit pngconf.h (Glenn R-P)
  Fixed memory leak in pngwrite.c (free info_ptr->text) (Glenn R-P)
  Added more conditions for png_do_background, to avoid changing
    black pixels to background when a background is supplied and
    no pixels are transparent
  Repaired PNG_NO_STDIO behavior
  Tested NODIV support and made it default behavior (Greg Roelofs)
  Added "-m" option and PNGTEST_DEBUG_MEMORY to pngtest (John Bowler)

    version number to 2 to avoid problems with libpng 0.89 apps
    (Greg Roelofs)

    PNG_READ_GAMMA_SUPPORTED and PNG_READ_hIST_SUPPORTED undefined
  Fixed some typos and made other minor rearrangement of libpng.txt (Andreas)
  Changed recommendation about file_gamma for PC images to .50 from .51 in
    example.c and libpng.txt, and changed file_gamma for sRGB images to .45

    the same structure.
  Added a test such that png_do_gamma will be done when num_trans==0

  Further optimization and bugfix of pngvcrd.c
  Revised pngset.c so that it does not allocate or free memory in the user's

    eliminated use of png_sig in pngwutil.c.  Moved the various png_CHNK arrays
    into pngtypes.h.  Eliminated use of global png_pass arrays.  Declared the
    png_CHNK and png_pass arrays to be "const".  Made the global arrays
    available to applications (although none are used in libpng itself) when
    PNG_NO_GLOBAL_ARRAYS is not defined or when PNG_GLOBAL_ARRAYS is defined.
  Removed some extraneous "-I" from contrib/pngminus/makefile.std
  Changed the PNG_sRGB_INTENT macros in png.h to be consistent with PNG-1.2.
  Change PNG_SRGB_INTENT to PNG_sRGB_INTENT in libpng.txt and libpng.3

Version 1.0.5d [November 29, 1999]
  Add type cast (png_const_charp) two places in png.c
  Eliminated pngtypes.h; use macros instead to declare PNG_CHNK arrays.

    PNG_USE_GLOBAL_ARRAYS is defined.
  Added PNG_EXPORT_VAR macro to accommodate making DLL's.

Version 1.0.5e [November 30, 1999]
  Added iCCP, iTXt, and sPLT support; added "lang" member to the png_text
    structure; refactored the inflate/deflate support to make adding new chunks
    with trailing compressed parts easier in the future, and added new functions
    png_free_iCCP, png_free_pCAL, png_free_sPLT, png_free_text, png_get_iCCP,
    png_get_spalettes, png_set_iCCP, png_set_spalettes (Eric S. Raymond).
  NOTE: Applications that write text chunks MUST define png_text->lang
    before calling png_set_text(). It must be set to NULL if you want to
    write tEXt or zTXt chunks.  If you want your application to be able to
    run with older versions of libpng, use

      #ifdef PNG_iTXt_SUPPORTED
         png_text[i].lang = NULL;
      #endif

  Changed png_get_oFFs() and png_set_oFFs() to use signed rather than unsigned
    offsets (Eric S. Raymond).
  Combined PNG_READ_cHNK_SUPPORTED and PNG_WRITE_cHNK_SUPPORTED macros into
    PNG_cHNK_SUPPORTED and combined the three types of PNG_text_SUPPORTED
    macros, leaving the separate macros also available.
  Removed comments on #endifs at the end of many short, non-nested #if-blocks.

  Added code to handle new chunks in pngpread.c
  Moved PNG_CHNK string macro definitions outside of PNG_NO_EXTERN block

  Added code in pngwrite.c to work around a newly discovered zlib bug.

Version 1.0.5h [December 10, 1999]
  NOTE: regarding the note for version 1.0.5e, the following must also
    be included in your code:
        png_text[i].translated_key = NULL;
  Unknown chunk handling is now supported.
  Option to eliminate all floating point support was added.  Some new
    fixed-point functions such as png_set_gAMA_fixed() were added.
  Expanded tabs and removed trailing blanks in source files.

Version 1.0.5i [December 13, 1999]
  Added some type casts to silence compiler warnings.
  Renamed "png_free_spalette" to "png_free_spalettes" for consistency.
  Removed leading blanks from a #define in pngvcrd.c

  Added a test for up->location != 0 in the first instance of writing
    unknown chunks in pngwrite.c
  Changed "num" to "i" in png_free_spalettes() and png_free_unknowns() to
    prevent recursion.
  Added png_free_hIST() function.
  Various patches to fix bugs in the sCAL and integer cHRM processing,
    and to add some convenience macros for use with sCAL.

Version 1.0.5j [December 21, 1999]
  Changed "unit" parameter of png_write_sCAL from png_byte to int, to work
    around buggy compilers.
  Added new type "png_fixed_point" for integers that hold float*100000 values
  Restored backward compatibility of tEXt/zTXt chunk processing:
    Restored the first four members of png_text to the same order as v.1.0.5d.
    Added members "lang_key" and "itxt_length" to png_text struct.  Set
    text_length=0 when "text" contains iTXt data.  Use the "compression"
    member to distinguish among tEXt/zTXt/iTXt types.  Added
    PNG_ITXT_COMPRESSION_NONE (1) and PNG_ITXT_COMPRESSION_zTXt(2) macros.
    The "Note" above, about backward incompatibility of libpng-1.0.5e, no
    longer applies.
  Fixed png_read|write_iTXt() to read|write parameters in the right order,
    and to write the iTXt chunk after IDAT if it appears in the end_ptr.
  Added pnggccrd.c, version of pngvcrd.c Intel assembler for gcc (Greg Roelofs)
  Reversed the order of trying to write floating-point and fixed-point gAMA.

  Added png_handle_as_unknown() function (Glenn)
  Added png_free_chunk_list() function and chunk_list and num_chunk_list members
    of png_ptr.
  Eliminated erroneous warnings about multiple sPLT chunks and sPLT-after-PLTE.
  Fixed a libpng-1.0.5h bug in pngrutil.c that was issuing erroneous warnings
    about ignoring incorrect gAMA with sRGB (gAMA was in fact not ignored)
  Added png_free_tRNS(); png_set_tRNS() now malloc's its own trans array (ESR).
  Define png_get_int_32 when oFFs chunk is supported as well as when pCAL is.
  Changed type of proflen from png_int_32 to png_uint_32 in png_get_iCCP().

Version 1.0.5l [January 1, 2000]
  Added functions png_set_read_user_chunk_fn() and png_get_user_chunk_ptr()
    for setting a callback function to handle unknown chunks and for
    retrieving the associated user pointer (Glenn).

Version 1.0.5m [January 7, 2000]
  Added high-level functions png_read_png(), png_write_png(), png_free_pixels().

Version 1.0.5n [January 9, 2000]
  Added png_free_PLTE() function, and modified png_set_PLTE() to malloc its
    own memory for info_ptr->palette.  This makes it safe for the calling
    application to free its copy of the palette any time after it calls
    png_set_PLTE().

Version 1.0.5o [January 20, 2000]
  Cosmetic changes only (removed some trailing blanks and TABs)

Version 1.0.5p [January 31, 2000]

    of png_get_text() in libpng.txt/libpng.3.

Version 1.0.5s [February 18, 2000]
  Added "png_jmp_env()" macro to pngconf.h, to help people migrate to the
    new error handler that's planned for the next libpng release, and changed
    example.c, pngtest.c, and contrib programs to use this macro.
  Revised some of the DLL-export macros in pngconf.h (Greg Roelofs)
  Fixed a bug in png_read_png() that caused it to fail to expand some images
    that it should have expanded.
  Fixed some mistakes in the unused and undocumented INCH_CONVERSIONS functions
    in pngget.c
  Changed the allocation of palette, history, and trans arrays back to
    the version 1.0.5 method (linking instead of copying) which restores
    backward compatibility with version 1.0.5.  Added some remarks about
    that in example.c.  Added "free_me" member to info_ptr and png_ptr
    and added png_free_data() function.
  Updated makefile.linux and makefile.gccmmx to make directories conditionally.

  Changed png_jmp_env() migration aiding macro to png_jmpbuf().
  Fixed "interlace" typo (should be "interlaced") in contrib/gregbook/read2-x.c
  Fixed bug with use of PNG_BEFORE_IHDR bit in png_ptr->mode, introduced when
    PNG_FLAG_HAVE_CHUNK_HEADER was moved into png_ptr->mode in version 1.0.5b
  Files in contrib/gregbook were revised to use png_jmpbuf() and to select
    a 24-bit visual if one is available, and to allow abbreviated options.
  Files in contrib/pngminus were revised to use the png_jmpbuf() macro.
  Removed spaces in makefile.linux and makefile.gcmmx, introduced in 1.0.5s

Version 1.0.5u [March 5, 2000]
  Simplified the code that detects old png.h in png.c and pngtest.c

Version 1.0.6e [April 9, 2000]
  Added png_data_freer() function.
  In the code that checks for over-length tRNS chunks, added check of
    info_ptr->num_trans as well as png_ptr->num_trans (Matthias Benckmann)
  Minor revisions of libpng.txt/libpng.3.
  Check for existing data and free it if the free_me flag is set, in png_set_*()
    and png_handle_*().
  Only define PNG_WEIGHTED_FILTERS_SUPPORTED when PNG_FLOATING_POINT_SUPPORTED
    is defined.
  Changed several instances of PNG_NO_CONSOLE_ID to PNG_NO_STDIO in pngrutil.c
    and mentioned the purposes of the two macros in libpng.txt/libpng.3.

Version 1.0.6f [April 14, 2000]

Version 1.0.6g [April 24, 2000]
  Added png_pass-* arrays to pnggccrd.c when PNG_USE_LOCAL_ARRAYS is defined.
  Relocated paragraph about png_set_background() in libpng.3/libpng.txt
    and other revisions (Matthias Benckmann)
  Relocated info_ptr->free_me, png_ptr->free_me, and other info_ptr and
    png_ptr members to restore binary compatibility with libpng-1.0.5
    (breaks compatibility with libpng-1.0.6).

Version 1.0.6h [April 24, 2000]
  Changed shared library so-number pattern from 2.x.y.z to xy.z (this builds
    libpng.so.10 & libpng.so.10.6h instead of libpng.so.2 & libpng.so.2.1.0.6h)
    This is a temporary change for test purposes.

Version 1.0.6i [May 2, 2000]
  Rearranged some members at the end of png_info and png_struct, to put
    unknown_chunks_num and free_me within the original size of the png_structs
    and free_me, png_read_user_fn, and png_free_fn within the original png_info,
    because some old applications allocate the structs directly instead of
    using png_create_*().
  Added documentation of user memory functions in libpng.txt/libpng.3
  Modified png_read_png so that it will use user_allocated row_pointers
    if present, unless free_me directs that it be freed, and added description
    of the use of png_set_rows() and png_get_rows() in libpng.txt/libpng.3.
  Added PNG_LEGACY_SUPPORTED macro, and #ifdef out all new (since version
    1.00) members of png_struct and png_info, to regain binary compatibility
    when you define this macro.  Capabilities lost in this event
    are user transforms (new in version 1.0.0),the user transform pointer
    (new in version 1.0.2), rgb_to_gray (new in 1.0.5), iCCP, sCAL, sPLT,
    the high-level interface, and unknown chunks support (all new in 1.0.6).
    This was necessary because of old applications that allocate the structs
    directly as authors were instructed to do in libpng-0.88 and earlier,
    instead of using png_create_*().
  Added modes PNG_CREATED_READ_STRUCT and PNG_CREATED_WRITE_STRUCT which
    can be used to detect codes that directly allocate the structs, and
    code to check these modes in png_read_init() and png_write_init() and
    generate a libpng error if the modes aren't set and PNG_LEGACY_SUPPORTED
    was not defined.
  Added makefile.intel and updated makefile.watcom (Pawel Mrochen)

Version 1.0.6j [May 3, 2000]
  Overloaded png_read_init() and png_write_init() with macros that convert
    calls to png_read_init_2() or png_write_init_2() that check the version
    and structure sizes.

Version 1.0.7beta11 [May 7, 2000]
  Removed the new PNG_CREATED_READ_STRUCT and PNG_CREATED_WRITE_STRUCT modes
    which are no longer used.
  Eliminated the three new members of png_text when PNG_LEGACY_SUPPORTED is
    defined or when neither PNG_READ_iTXt_SUPPORTED nor PNG_WRITE_iTXT_SUPPORTED
    is defined.
  Made PNG_NO_READ|WRITE_iTXt the default setting, to avoid memory
    overrun when old applications fill the info_ptr->text structure directly.
  Added PNGAPI macro, and added it to the definitions of all exported functions.
  Relocated version macro definitions ahead of the includes of zlib.h and
    pngconf.h in png.h.

Version 1.0.7beta12 [May 12, 2000]
  Revised pngset.c to avoid a problem with expanding the png_debug macro.
  Deleted some extraneous defines from pngconf.h
  Made PNG_NO_CONSOLE_IO the default condition when PNG_BUILD_DLL is defined.
  Use MSC _RPTn debugging instead of fprintf if _MSC_VER is defined.
  Added png_access_version_number() function.
  Check for mask&PNG_FREE_CHNK (for TEXT, SCAL, PCAL) in png_free_data().
  Expanded libpng.3/libpng.txt information about png_data_freer().

Version 1.0.7beta14 [May 17, 2000] (beta13 was not published)
  Changed pnggccrd.c and pngvcrd.c to handle bad adaptive filter types as
    warnings instead of errors, as pngrutil.c does.
  Set the PNG_INFO_IDAT valid flag in png_set_rows() so png_write_png()
    will actually write IDATs.
  Made the default PNG_USE_LOCAL_ARRAYS depend on PNG_DLL instead of WIN32.
  Make png_free_data() ignore its final parameter except when freeing data
    that can have multiple instances (text, sPLT, unknowns).
  Fixed a new bug in png_set_rows().
  Removed info_ptr->valid tests from png_free_data(), as in version 1.0.5.
  Added png_set_invalid() function.
  Fixed incorrect illustrations of png_destroy_write_struct() in example.c.

Version 1.0.7beta15 [May 30, 2000]
  Revised the deliberately erroneous Linux setjmp code in pngconf.h to produce
    fewer error messages.
  Rearranged checks for Z_OK to check the most likely path first in pngpread.c
    and pngwutil.c.
  Added checks in pngtest.c for png_create_*() returning NULL, and mentioned
    in libpng.txt/libpng.3 the need for applications to check this.
  Changed names of png_default_*() functions in pngtest to pngtest_*().
  Changed return type of png_get_x|y_offset_*() from png_uint_32 to png_int_32.
  Fixed some bugs in the unused PNG_INCH_CONVERSIONS functions in pngget.c
  Set each pointer to NULL after freeing it in png_free_data().
  Worked around a problem in pngconf.h; AIX's strings.h defines an "index"
    macro that conflicts with libpng's png_color_16.index. (Dimitri
    Papadapoulos)
  Added "msvc" directory with MSVC++ project files (Simon-Pierre Cadieux).

Version 1.0.7beta16 [June 4, 2000]
  Revised the workaround of AIX string.h "index" bug.
  Added a check for overlength PLTE chunk in pngrutil.c.
  Added PNG_NO_POINTER_INDEXING macro to use array-indexing instead of pointer
    indexing in pngrutil.c and pngwutil.c to accommodate a buggy compiler.
  Added a warning in png_decompress_chunk() when it runs out of data, e.g.
    when it tries to read an erroneous PhotoShop iCCP chunk.
  Added PNG_USE_DLL macro.
  Revised the copyright/disclaimer/license notice.
  Added contrib/msvctest directory

Version 1.0.7rc1 [June 9, 2000]
  Corrected the definition of PNG_TRANSFORM_INVERT_ALPHA  (0x0400 not 0x0200)
  Added contrib/visupng directory (Willem van Schaik)

Version 1.0.7beta18 [June 23, 2000]

  Added project files to the wince directory and made further revisions
     of pngtest.c, pngrio.c, and pngwio.c in support of WindowsCE.

Version 1.0.8beta3 [July 11, 2000]
  Only set the PNG_FLAG_FREE_TRNS or PNG_FREE_TRNS flag in png_handle_tRNS()
     for indexed-color input files to avoid potential double-freeing trans array
     under some unusual conditions; problem was introduced in version 1.0.6f.
  Further revisions to pngtest.c and files in the wince subdirectory.

Version 1.0.8beta4 [July 14, 2000]
  Added the files pngbar.png and pngbar.jpg to the distribution.
  Added makefile.cygwin, and cygwin support in pngconf.h

Version 1.4.0beta80 [September 17, 2009]
  Removed scripts/libpng.icc
  Changed typecast of filler from png_byte to png_uint_16 in png_set_filler().
    (Dennis Gustafsson)

Version 1.4.0beta81 [September 23, 2009]
  Eliminated unused PNG_FLAG_FREE_* defines from pngpriv.h
  Expanded TAB characters in pngrtran.c
  Removed PNG_CONST from all "PNG_CONST PNG_CHNK" declarations to avoid
    compiler complaints about doubly declaring things "const".
  Changed all "#if [!]defined(X)" to "if[n]def X" where possible.
  Eliminated unused png_ptr->row_buf_size

Version 1.4.0beta82 [September 25, 2009]
  Moved redundant IHDR checking into new png_check_IHDR() in png.c
    and report all errors found in the IHDR data.
  Eliminated useless call to png_check_cHRM() from pngset.c

Version 1.4.0beta83 [September 25, 2009]

    the contents of the returned parameters.

Version 1.4.0beta86 [October 9, 2009]
  Updated the "xcode" project (Alam Arias).
  Eliminated a shadowed declaration of "pp" in png_handle_sPLT().

Version 1.4.0rc01 [October 19, 2009]
  Trivial cosmetic changes.

  Moved version 1.4.0 back into beta.

Version 1.4.0beta88 [October 30, 2009]
  Revised libpng*.txt section about differences between 1.2.x and 1.4.0
    because most of the new features have now been ported back to 1.2.41

  More bugfixes and improvements to CMakeLists.txt (Philip Lowman)
  Removed a harmless extra png_set_invert_alpha() from pngwrite.c

    of differences from 1.2.41 to 1.4.0)

Version 1.4.0beta93 [November 7, 2009]
  Added PNG_DEPSTRUCT, PNG_DEPRECATED, PNG_USE_RESULT, PNG_NORETURN, and
    PNG_ALLOCATED macros to detect deprecated direct access to the
    png_struct or info_struct members and other deprecated usage in
    applications (John Bowler).
  Updated scripts/makefile* to add "-DPNG_CONFIGURE_LIBPNG" to CFLAGS,
    to prevent warnings about direct access to png structs by libpng
    functions while building libpng.  They need to be tested, especially
    those using compilers other than gcc.
  Updated projects/visualc6 and visualc71 with "/d PNG_CONFIGURE_LIBPNG".
    They should work but still need to be updated to remove
    references to pnggccrd.c or pngvcrd.c and ASM building.
  Added README.txt to the beos, cbuilder5, netware, and xcode projects warning
    that they need to be updated, to remove references to pnggccrd.c and
    pngvcrd.c and to depend on pngpriv.h
  Removed three direct references to read_info_ptr members in pngtest.c
    that were detected by the new PNG_DEPSTRUCT macro.

    png_write_destroy() and png_far_to_near() prototypes from png.h
    to pngpriv.h (John Bowler)
  Moved the synopsis lines for png_read_destroy(), png_write_destroy()
    png_debug(), png_debug1(), and png_debug2() from libpng.3 to libpngpf.3.

  Updated CMakeLists.txt to add "-DPNG_CONFIGURE_LIBPNG" to the definitions.
  Removed dependency of pngtest.o on pngpriv.h in the makefiles.
  Only #define PNG_DEPSTRUCT, etc. in pngconf.h if not already defined.

Version 1.4.0beta95 [November 10, 2009]
  Changed png_check_sig() to !png_sig_cmp() in contrib programs.

  Corrected the png_get_IHDR() call in contrib/gregbook/readpng2.c
  Changed pngminim/*/gather.sh to stop trying to remove pnggccrd.c and pngvcrd.c
  Added dependency on pngpriv.h in contrib/pngminim/*/makefile

Version 1.4.0beta96 [November 12, 2009]
  Renamed scripts/makefile.wce to scripts/makefile.cegcc

    so that only PNG_EXPORT functions are exported.
  Removed the deprecated png_check_sig() function/macro.
  Removed recently removed function names from scripts/*.def
  Revised pngtest.png to put chunks in the same order written by pngtest
    (evidently the same change made in libpng-1.0beta54 was lost).
  Added PNG_PRIVATE macro definition in pngconf.h for possible future use.

Version 1.4.0beta97 [November 13, 2009]
  Restored pngtest.png to the libpng-1.4.0beta7 version.
  Removed projects/beos and netware.txt; no one seems to be supporting them.
  Revised Makefile.in

Version 1.4.0beta98 [November 13, 2009]
  Added the "xcode" project to zip distributions,
  Fixed a typo in scripts/pngwin.def introduced in beta97.

Version 1.4.0beta99 [November 14, 2009]
  Moved libpng-config.in and libpng.pc-configure.in out of the scripts
    directory, to libpng-config.in and libpng-pc.in, respectively, and
    modified Makefile.am and configure.ac accordingly.  Now "configure"
    needs nothing from the "scripts" directory.
  Avoid redefining PNG_CONST in pngconf.h

Version 1.4.0beta100 [November 14, 2009]
  Removed ASM builds from projects/visualc6 and projects/visualc71
  Removed scripts/makefile.nommx and makefile.vcawin32
  Revised CMakeLists.txt to account for new location of libpng-config.in
    and libpng-pc.in
  Updated INSTALL to reflect removal and relocation of files.

Version 1.4.0beta101 [November 14, 2009]
  Restored the binary files (*.jpg, *.png, some project files) that were
    accidentally deleted from the zip and 7z distributions when the xcode
    project was added.

Version 1.4.0beta102 [November 18, 2009]
  Added libpng-config.in and libpng-pc.in to the zip and 7z distributions.
  Fixed a typo in projects/visualc6/pngtest.dsp, introduced in beta100.
  Moved descriptions of makefiles and other scripts out of INSTALL into
    scripts/README.txt
  Updated the copyright year in scripts/pngwin.rc from 2006 to 2009.

Version 1.4.0beta103 [November 21, 2009]
  Removed obsolete comments about ASM from projects/visualc71/README_zlib.txt
  Align row_buf on 16-byte boundary in memory.
  Restored the PNG_WRITE_FLUSH_AFTER_IEND_SUPPORTED guard around the call
    to png_flush() after png_write_IEND().  See 1.4.0beta32, 1.4.0beta50
    changes above and 1.2.30, 1.2.30rc01 and rc03 in 1.2.41 CHANGES.  Someone
    needs this feature.
  Make the 'png_jmpbuf' macro expand to a call that records the correct
    longjmp function as well as returning a pointer to the setjmp
    jmp_buf buffer, and marked direct access to jmpbuf 'deprecated'.
    (John Bowler)

Version 1.4.0beta104 [November 22, 2009]
  Removed png_longjmp_ptr from scripts/*.def and libpng.3
  Rebuilt configure scripts with autoconf-2.65

Version 1.4.0beta105 [November 25, 2009]
  Use fast integer PNG_DIVIDE_BY_255() or PNG_DIVIDE_BY_65535()
    to accomplish alpha premultiplication when
    PNG_READ_COMPOSITE_NODIV_SUPPORTED is defined.
  Changed "/255" to "/255.0" in background calculations to make it clear
    that the 255 is used as a double.

Version 1.4.0beta106 [November 27, 2009]
  Removed premultiplied alpha feature.

Version 1.4.0beta107 [December 4, 2009]
  Updated README
  Added "#define PNG_NO_PEDANTIC_WARNINGS" in the libpng source files.
  Removed "-DPNG_CONFIGURE_LIBPNG" from the makefiles and projects.
  Revised scripts/makefile.netbsd, makefile.openbsd, and makefile.sco
    to put png.h and pngconf.h in $prefix/include, like the other scripts,
    instead of in $prefix/include/libpng.  Also revised makefile.sco
    to put them in $prefix/include/libpng15 instead of in
    $prefix/include/libpng/libpng15.

Version 1.4.0beta108 [December 11, 2009]
  Removed leftover "-DPNG_CONFIGURE_LIBPNG" from contrib/pngminim/*/makefile
  Relocated png_do_chop() to its original position in pngrtran.c; the
    change in version 1.2.41beta08 caused transparency to be handled wrong
    in some 16-bit datastreams (Yusaku Sugai).

Version 1.4.0beta109 [December 13, 2009]
  Added "bit_depth" parameter to the private png_build_gamma_table() function.
  Pass bit_depth=8 to png_build_gamma_table() when bit_depth is 16 but the
    PNG_16_TO_8 transform has been set, to avoid unnecessary build of 16-bit
    tables.

Version 1.4.0rc02 [December 20, 2009]
  Declared png_cleanup_needed "volatile" in pngread.c and pngwrite.c

Version 1.4.0rc03 [December 22, 2009]
  Renamed libpng-pc.in back to libpng.pc.in and revised CMakeLists.txt
    (revising the change in 1.4.0beta99)

Version 1.4.0rc04 [December 25, 2009]
  Swapped PNG_UNKNOWN_CHUNKS_SUPPORTED and PNG_HANDLE_AS_UNKNOWN_SUPPORTED
    in pngset.c to be consistent with other changes in version 1.2.38.

Version 1.4.0rc05 [December 25, 2009]
  Changed "libpng-pc.in" to "libpng.pc.in" in configure.ac, configure, and
    Makefile.in to be consistent with changes in libpng-1.4.0rc03

Version 1.4.0rc06 [December 29, 2009]
  Reverted the gamma_table changes from libpng-1.4.0beta109.
  Fixed some indentation errors.

Version 1.4.0rc07 [January 1, 2010]
  Revised libpng*.txt and libpng.3 about 1.2.x->1.4.x differences.
  Use png_calloc() instead of png_malloc(); png_memset() in pngrutil.c
  Update copyright year to 2010.

Version 1.4.0rc08 [January 2, 2010]

    in pngtest.c

Version 1.4.0 [January 3, 2010]
  No changes.

Version 1.4.1beta01 [January 8, 2010]
  Updated CMakeLists.txt for consistent indentation and to avoid an
    unclosed if-statement warning (Philip Lowman).
  Revised Makefile.am and Makefile.in to remove references to Y2KINFO,
    KNOWNBUG, and libpng.la (Robert Schwebel).
  Revised the makefiles to install the same files and symbolic
    links as configure, except for libpng.la and libpng14.la.
  Make png_set|get_compression_buffer_size() available even when
    PNG_WRITE_SUPPORTED is not enabled.
  Revised Makefile.am and Makefile.in to simplify their maintenance.
  Revised scripts/makefile.linux to install a link to libpng14.so.14.1

Version 1.4.1beta02 [January 9, 2010]
  Revised the rest of the makefiles to install a link to libpng14.so.14.1

Version 1.4.1beta03 [January 10, 2010]
  Removed png_set_premultiply_alpha() from scripts/*.def

Version 1.4.1rc01 [January 16, 2010]
  No changes.

Version 1.4.1beta04 [January 23, 2010]
  Revised png_decompress_chunk() to improve speed and memory usage when
    decoding large chunks.
  Added png_set|get_chunk_malloc_max() functions.

Version 1.4.1beta05 [January 26, 2010]
  Relocated "int k" declaration in pngtest.c to minimize its scope.

Version 1.4.1beta06 [January 28, 2010]

    John Bowler.

Version 1.4.1beta07 [February 6, 2010]
  Folded some long lines in the source files.
  Added defineable PNG_USER_CHUNK_CACHE_MAX, PNG_USER_CHUNK_MALLOC_MAX,
    and a PNG_USER_LIMITS_SUPPORTED flag.
  Eliminated use of png_ptr->irowbytes and reused the slot in png_ptr as
    png_ptr->png_user_chunk_malloc_max.
  Revised png_push_save_buffer() to do fewer but larger png_malloc() calls.

Version 1.4.1beta08 [February 6, 2010]
  Minor cleanup and updating of dates and copyright year.

Version 1.5.0beta01 [February 7, 2010]
  Moved declaration of png_struct into private pngstruct.h and png_info
    into pnginfo.h

Version 1.4.1beta09 and 1.5.0beta02 [February 7, 2010]
  Reverted to original png_push_save_buffer() code.

Version 1.4.1beta10 and 1.5.0beta03 [February 8, 2010]
  Return allocated "old_buffer" in png_push_save_buffer() before
    calling png_error(), to avoid a potential memory leak.
  Updated configure script to use SO number 15.

Version 1.5.0beta04 [February 9, 2010]
  Removed malformed "incomplete struct declaration" of png_info from png.h

Version 1.5.0beta05 [February 12, 2010]
  Removed PNG_DEPSTRUCT markup in pngstruct.h and pnginfo.h, and undid the
    linewrapping that it entailed.
  Revised comments in pngstruct.h and pnginfo.h and added pointers to
    the libpng license.
  Changed PNG_INTERNAL to PNG_EXPOSE_INTERNAL_STRUCTURES
  Removed the cbuilder5 project, which has not been updated to 1.4.0.

Version 1.4.1beta12 and 1.5.0beta06 [February 14, 2010]
  Fixed type declaration of png_get_chunk_malloc_max() in pngget.c (Daisuke
    Nishikawa)

Version 1.5.0beta07 [omitted]

Version 1.5.0beta08 [February 19, 2010]
  Changed #ifdef PNG_NO_STDIO_SUPPORTED to #ifdef PNG_NO_CONSOLE_IO_SUPPORTED
    wherever png_snprintf() is used to construct error and warning messages.
  Noted in scripts/makefile.mingw that it expects to be run under MSYS.
  Removed obsolete unused MMX-querying support from contrib/gregbook
  Added exported png_longjmp() function.
  Removed the AIX redefinition of jmpbuf in png.h
  Added -D_ALLSOURCE in configure.ac, makefile.aix, and CMakeLists.txt
    when building on AIX.

Version 1.5.0beta09 [February 19, 2010]
  Removed -D_ALLSOURCE from configure.ac, makefile.aix, and CMakeLists.txt.
  Changed the name of png_ptr->jmpbuf to png_ptr->png_jmpbuf in pngstruct.h

Version 1.5.0beta10 [February 25, 2010]
  Removed unused gzio.c from contrib/pngminim gather and makefile scripts
  Removed replacement error handlers from contrib/gregbook.  Because of
    the new png_longjmp() function they are no longer needed.

Version 1.5.0beta11 [March 6, 2010]
  Removed checking for already-included setjmp.h from pngconf.h
  Fixed inconsistent indentations and made numerous cosmetic changes.
  Revised the "SEE ALSO" style of libpng.3, libpngpf.3, and png.5

Version 1.5.0beta12 [March 9, 2010]
  Moved "#include png.h" inside pngpriv.h and removed "#include png.h" from
    the source files, along with "#define PNG_EXPOSE_INTERNAL_STRUCTURES"
    and "#define PNG_NO_PEDANTIC_WARNINGS" (John Bowler).
  Created new pngdebug.h and moved debug definitions there.

Version 1.5.0beta13 [March 10, 2010]
  Protect pngstruct.h, pnginfo.h, and pngdebug.h from being included twice.
  Revise the "#ifdef" blocks in png_inflate() so it will compile when neither
    PNG_USER_CHUNK_MALLOC_MAX nor PNG_SET_CHUNK_MALLOC_LIMIT_SUPPORTED
    is defined.
  Removed unused png_measure_compressed_chunk() from pngpriv.h and libpngpf.3
  Moved the 'config.h' support from pngconf.h to pngpriv.h
  Removed PNGAPI from the png_longjmp_ptr typedef.
  Eliminated dependence of pngtest.c on the private pngdebug.h file.
  Make all png_debug macros into *unterminated* statements or
    expressions (i.e. a trailing ';' must always be added) and correct
    the format statements in various png_debug messages.

Version 1.5.0beta14 [March 14, 2010]
  Removed direct access to png_ptr->io_ptr from the Windows code in pngtest.c
  Revised Makefile.am to account for recent additions and replacements.
  Corrected CE and OS/2 DEF files (scripts/png*def) for symbols removed and
    added ordinal numbers to the Windows DEF file and corrected the duplicated
    ordinal numbers on CE symbols that are commented out.
  Added back in export symbols that can be present in the Windows build but
    are disabled by default.
  PNG_EXPORT changed to include an 'ordinal' field for DEF file generation.
    PNG_CALLBACK added to make callback definitions uniform.  PNGAPI split
    into PNGCAPI (base C form), PNGAPI (exports) and PNGCBAPI (callbacks),
    and appropriate changes made to all files.  Cygwin builds re-hinged to
    allow procedure call standard changes and to remove the need for the DEF
    file (fixes build on Cygwin).
  Enabled 'attribute' warnings that are relevant to library APIs and callbacks.
  Changed rules for generation of the various symbol files and added a new
    rule for a DEF file (which is also added to the distribution).
  Updated the symbol file generation to stop it adding spurious spaces
    to EOL (coming from preprocessor macro expansion).  Added a facility
    to join tokens in the output and rewrite *.dfn to use this.
  Eliminated scripts/*.def in favor of libpng.def; updated projects/visualc71
    and removed scripts/makefile.cygwin.
  Made PNG_BUILD_DLL safe: it can be set whenever a DLL is being built.
  Removed the include of sys/types.h - apparently unnecessary now on the
    platforms on which it happened (all but Mac OS and RISC OS).
  Moved the Mac OS test into pngpriv.h (the only place it is used.)

Version 1.5.0beta15 [March 17, 2010]
  Added symbols.chk target to Makefile.am to validate the symbols in png.h
    against the new DEF file scripts/symbols.def.
  Changed the default DEF file back to pngwin.def.
  Removed makefile.mingw.
  Eliminated PNG_NO_EXTERN and PNG_ALL_EXTERN

Version 1.5.0beta16 [April 1, 2010]
  Make png_text_struct independent of PNG_iTXt_SUPPORTED, so that
    fields are initialized in all configurations.  The READ/WRITE
    macros (PNG_(READ|WRITE)_iTXt_SUPPORTED) still function as
    before to disable code to actually read or write iTXt chunks
    and iTXt_SUPPORTED can be used to detect presence of either
    read or write support (but it is probably better to check for
    the one actually required - read or write.)
  Combined multiple png_warning() calls for a single error.
  Restored the macro definition of png_check_sig().

Version 1.5.0beta17 [April 17, 2010]
  Added some "(long)" typecasts to printf calls in png_handle_cHRM().
  Documented the fact that png_set_dither() was disabled since libpng-1.4.0.
  Reenabled png_set_dither() but renamed it to png_set_quantize() to reflect
    more accurately what it actually does.  At the same time, renamed
    the PNG_DITHER_[RED,GREEN_BLUE]_BITS macros to
    PNG_QUANTIZE_[RED,GREEN,BLUE]_BITS.
  Added some "(long)" typecasts to printf calls in png_handle_cHRM().
  Freeze build-time only configuration in the build.
    In all prior versions of libpng most configuration options
    controlled by compiler #defines had to be repeated by the
    application code that used libpng.  This patch changes this
    so that compilation options that can only be changed at build
    time are frozen in the build.  Options that are compiler
    dependent (and those that are system dependent) are evaluated
    each time - pngconf.h holds these.  Options that can be changed
    per-file in the application are in png.h.  Frozen options are
    in the new installed header file pnglibconf.h (John Bowler)
  Removed the xcode project because it has not been updated to work
    with libpng-1.5.0.
  Removed the ability to include optional pngusr.h

Version 1.5.0beta18 [April 17, 2010]
  Restored the ability to include optional pngusr.h
  Moved replacements for png_error() and png_warning() from the
    contrib/pngminim project to pngerror.c, for use when warnings or
    errors are disabled via PNG_NO_WARN or PNG_NO_ERROR_TEXT, to avoid
    storing unneeded error/warning text.
  Updated contrib/pngminim project to work with the new pnglibconf.h
  Added some PNG_NO_* defines to contrib/pngminim/*/pngusr.h to save space.

Version 1.5.0beta19 [April 24, 2010]
  Added PNG_{READ,WRITE}_INT_FUNCTIONS_SUPPORTED.  This allows the functions
    to read and write ints to be disabled independently of PNG_USE_READ_MACROS,
    which allows libpng to be built with the functions even though the default
    is to use the macros - this allows applications to choose at app build
    time whether or not to use macros (previously impossible because the
    functions weren't in the default build.)
  Changed Windows calling convention back to __cdecl for API functions.
    For Windows/x86 platforms only:
      __stdcall is no longer needed for Visual Basic, so libpng-1.5.0 uses
      __cdecl throughout (both API functions and callbacks) on Windows/x86
      platforms.
  Replaced visualc6 and visualc71 projects with new vstudio project
  Relaxed the overly-restrictive permissions of some files.

Version 1.5.0beta20 [April 24, 2010]
  Relaxed more overly-restrictive permissions of some files.

Version 1.5.0beta21 [April 27, 2010]
  Removed some unwanted binary bytes and changed CRLF to NEWLINE in the new
    vstudio project files, and some trivial editing of some files in the
    scripts directory.
  Set PNG_NO_READ_BGR, PNG_NO_IO_STATE, and PNG_NO_TIME_RFC1123 in
    contrib/pngminim/decoder/pngusr.h to make a smaller decoder application.

Version 1.5.0beta22 [April 28, 2010]
  Fixed dependencies of GET_INT_32 - it does not require READ_INT_FUNCTIONS
    because it has a macro equivalent.
  Improved the options.awk script; added an "everything off" option.
  Revised contrib/pngminim to use the "everything off" option in pngusr.dfa.

Version 1.5.0beta23 [April 29, 2010]
  Corrected PNG_REMOVED macro to take five arguments.
    The macro was documented with two arguments (name,ordinal), however
    the symbol checking .dfn files assumed five arguments.  The five
    argument form seems more useful so it is changed to that.
  Corrected PNG_UNKNOWN_CHUNKS_SUPPORTED to PNG_HANDLE_AS_UNKNOWN_SUPPORTED
    in gregbook/readpng2.c
  Corrected protection of png_get_user_transform_ptr. The API declaration in
    png.h is removed if both READ and WRITE USER_TRANSFORM are turned off
    but was left defined in pngtrans.c
  Added logunsupported=1 to cause pnglibconf.h to document disabled options.
    This makes the installed pnglibconf.h more readable but causes no
    other change.  The intention is that users of libpng will find it
    easier to understand if an API they need is missing.
  Include png_reset_zstream() in png.c only when PNG_READ_SUPPORTED is defined.
  Removed dummy_inflate.c from contrib/pngminim/encoder
  Removed contrib/pngminim/*/gather.sh; gathering is now done in the makefile.

Version 1.5.0beta24 [May 7, 2010]
  Use bitwise "&" instead of arithmetic mod in pngrutil.c calculation of the
    offset of the png_ptr->rowbuf pointer into png_ptr->big_row_buf.
  Added more blank lines for readability.

Version 1.5.0beta25 [June 18, 2010]
  In pngpread.c: png_push_have_row() add check for new_row > height
  Removed the now-redundant check for out-of-bounds new_row from example.c

Version 1.5.0beta26 [June 18, 2010]
  In pngpread.c: png_push_process_row() add check for too many rows.

Version 1.5.0beta27 [June 18, 2010]
  Removed the check added in beta25 as it is now redundant.

Version 1.5.0beta28 [June 20, 2010]
  Rewrote png_process_IDAT_data to consistently treat extra data as warnings
    and handle end conditions more cleanly.
  Removed the new (beta26) check in png_push_process_row().

Version 1.5.0beta29 [June 21, 2010]
  Revised scripts/options.awk to work on Sunos (but still doesn't work)
  Added comment to options.awk and contrib/pngminim/*/makefile to try nawk.

Version 1.5.0beta30 [June 22, 2010]
  Stop memory leak when reading a malformed sCAL chunk.

Version 1.5.0beta31 [June 26, 2010]
  Revised pngpread.c patch of beta28 to avoid an endless loop.
  Removed some trailing blanks.

Version 1.5.0beta32 [June 26, 2010]
  Removed leftover scripts/options.patch and scripts/options.rej

Version 1.5.0beta33 [July 6, 3010]
  Made FIXED and FLOATING options consistent in the APIs they enable and
    disable.  Corrected scripts/options.awk to handle both command line
    options and options specified in the .dfa files.
  Changed char *msg to PNG_CONST char *msg in pngrutil.c
  Make png_set_sRGB_gAMA_and_cHRM set values using either the fixed or
    floating point APIs, but not both.
  Reversed patch to remove error handler when the jmp_buf is stored in the
    main program structure, not the png_struct.
    The error handler is needed because the default handler in libpng will
    always use the jmp_buf in the library control structure; this is never
    set.  The gregbook code is a useful example because, even though it
    uses setjmp/longjmp, it shows how error handling can be implemented
    using control mechanisms not directly supported by libpng.  The
    technique will work correctly with mechanisms such as Microsoft
    Structure Exceptions or C++ exceptions (compiler willing - note that gcc
    does not by default support interworking of C and C++ error handling.)
  Reverted changes to call png_longjmp in contrib/gregbook where it is not
    appropriate.  If mainprog->jmpbuf is used by setjmp, then png_longjmp
    cannot be used.
  Changed "extern PNG_EXPORT" to "PNG_EXPORT" in png.h (Jan Nijtmans)
  Changed "extern" to "PNG_EXTERN" in pngpriv.h (except for the 'extern "C" {')

Version 1.5.0beta34 [July 12, 2010]
  Put #ifndef PNG_EXTERN, #endif around the define PNG_EXTERN in pngpriv.h

Version 1.5.0beta35 [July 24, 2010]
  Removed some newly-added TAB characters.
  Added -DNO_PNG_SNPRINTF to CFLAGS in scripts/makefile.dj2
  Moved the definition of png_snprintf() outside of the enclosing
    #ifdef blocks in pngconf.h

Version 1.5.0beta36 [July 29, 2010]
  Patches by John Bowler:
  Fixed point APIs are now supported throughout (no missing APIs).
  Internal fixed point arithmetic support exists for all internal floating
    point operations.
  sCAL validates the floating point strings it is passed.
  Safe, albeit rudimentary, Watcom support is provided by PNG_API_RULE==2
  Two new APIs exist to get the number of passes without turning on the
    PNG_INTERLACE transform and to get the number of rows in the current
    pass.
  A new test program, pngvalid.c, validates the gamma code.
  Errors in the 16-bit gamma correction (overflows) have been corrected.
  cHRM chunk testing is done consistently (previously the floating point
    API bypassed it, because the test really didn't work on FP, now the test
    is performed on the actual values to be stored in the PNG file so it
    works in the FP case too.)
  Most floating point APIs now simply call the fixed point APIs after
    converting the values to the fixed point form used in the PNG file.
  The standard headers no longer include zlib.h, which is currently only
    required for pngstruct.h and can therefore be internal.
  Revised png_get_int_32 to undo the PNG two's complement representation of
    negative numbers.

Version 1.5.0beta37 [July 30, 2010]
  Added a typecast in png_get_int_32() in png.h and pngrutil.h to avoid
    a compiler warning.
  Replaced oFFs 0,0 with oFFs -10,20 in pngtest.png

Version 1.5.0beta38 [July 31, 2010]
  Implemented remaining "_fixed" functions.
  Corrected a number of recently introduced warnings mostly resulting from
    safe but uncast assignments to shorter integers.  Also added a zlib
    VStudio release library project because the latest zlib Official Windows
    build does not include such a thing.
  Revised png_get_int_16() to be similar to png_get_int_32().
  Restored projects/visualc71.

Version 1.5.0beta39 [August 2, 2010]
  VisualC/GCC warning fixes, VisualC build fixes
  The changes include support for function attributes in VC in addition to
    those already present in GCC - necessary because without these some
    warnings are unavoidable.  Fixes include signed/unsigned fixes in
    pngvalid and checks with gcc -Wall -Wextra -Wunused.
  VC requires function attributes on function definitions as well as
    declarations, PNG_FUNCTION has been added to enable this and the
    relevant function definitions changed.

Version 1.5.0beta40 [August 6, 2010]
  Correct use of _WINDOWS_ in pngconf.h
  Removed png_mem_ #defines; they are no longer used.
  Added the sRGB chunk to pngtest.png

Version 1.5.0beta41 [August 11, 2010]
  Added the cHRM chunk to pngtest.png
  Don't try to use version-script with cygwin/mingw.
  Revised contrib/gregbook to work under cygwin/mingw.

Version 1.5.0beta42 [August 18, 2010]
  Add .dll.a to the list of extensions to be symlinked by Makefile.am (Yaakov)
  Made all API functions that have const arguments and constant string
    literal pointers declare them (John Bowler).

Version 1.5.0beta43 [August 20, 2010]
  Removed spurious tabs, shorten long lines (no source change)
    Also added scripts/chkfmt to validate the format of all the files that can
    reasonably be validated (it is suggested to run "make distclean" before
    checking, because some machine generated files have long lines.)
  Reformatted the CHANGES file to be more consistent throughout.
  Made changes to address various issues identified by GCC, mostly
    signed/unsigned and shortening problems on assignment but also a few
    difficult to optimize (for GCC) loops.
  Fixed non-GCC fixed point builds.  In png.c a declaration was misplaced
    in an earlier update.  Fixed to declare the auto variables at the head.
  Use cexcept.h in pngvalid.c.

Version 1.5.0beta44 [August 24, 2010]
  Updated CMakeLists.txt to use CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR variable; useful for
    installing libpng in /usr/lib64 (Funda Wang).
  Revised CMakeLists.txt to put the man pages in share/man/man* not man/man*
  Revised CMakeLists.txt to make symlinks instead of copies when installing.
  Changed PNG_LIB_NAME from pngNN to libpngNN in CMakeLists.txt (Philip Lowman)
  Implemented memory checks within pngvalid
  Reformatted/rearranged pngvalid.c to assist use of progressive reader.
  Check interlaced images in pngvalid
  Clarified pngusr.h comments in pnglibconf.dfa
  Simplified the pngvalid error-handling code now that cexcept.h is in place.
  Implemented progressive reader in pngvalid.c for standard tests
  Implemented progressive read in pngvalid.c gamma tests
  Turn on progressive reader in pngvalid.c by default and tidy code.

Version 1.5.0beta45 [August 26, 2010]
  Added an explicit make step to projects/vstudio for pnglibconf.h
    Also corrected zlib.vcxproj into which Visual Studio had introduced
    what it calls an "authoring error".  The change to make pnglibconf.h
    simply copies the file; in the future it may actually generate the
    file from scripts/pnglibconf.dfa as the other build systems do.
  Changed pngvalid to work when floating point APIs are disabled
  Renamed the prebuilt scripts/pnglibconf.h to scripts/pnglibconf.h.prebuilt
  Supply default values for PNG_USER_PRIVATEBUILD and PNG_USER_DLLFNAME_POSTFIX
    in pngpriv.h in case the user neglected to define them in their pngusr.h

Version 1.5.0beta46 [August 28, 2010]
  Added new private header files to libpng_sources in CMakeLists.txt
  Added PNG_READ_16BIT, PNG_WRITE_16BIT, and PNG_16BIT options.
  Added reference to scripts/pnglibconf.h.prebuilt in the visualc71 project.

Version 1.5.0beta47 [September 11, 2010]
  Fixed a number of problems with 64-bit compilation reported by Visual
    Studio 2010 (John Bowler).

Version 1.5.0beta48 [October 4, 2010]
  Updated CMakeLists.txt (Philip Lowman).
  Revised autogen.sh to recognize and use $AUTOCONF, $AUTOMAKE, $AUTOHEADER,
    $AUTOPOINT, $ACLOCAL and $LIBTOOLIZE
  Fixed problem with symbols creation in Makefile.am which was assuming that
    all versions of ccp write to standard output by default (Martin Banky). The
    bug was introduced in libpng-1.2.9beta5.
  Removed unused mkinstalldirs.

Version 1.5.0beta49 [October 8, 2010]
  Undid Makefile.am revision of 1.5.0beta48.

Version 1.5.0beta50 [October 14, 2010]
  Revised Makefile.in to account for mkinstalldirs being removed.
  Added some "(unsigned long)" typecasts in printf statements in pngvalid.c.
  Suppressed a compiler warning in png_handle_sPLT().
  Check for out-of-range text compression mode in png_set_text().

Version 1.5.0beta51 [October 15, 2010]
  Changed embedded dates to "(PENDING RELEASE) in beta releases (and future
    rc releases) to minimize the difference between releases.

Version 1.5.0beta52 [October 16, 2010]
  Restored some of the embedded dates (in png.h, png.c, documentation, etc.)

Version 1.5.0beta53 [October 18, 2010]
  Updated INSTALL to mention using "make maintainer-clean" and to remove
    obsolete statement about a custom ltmain.sh
  Disabled "color-tests" by default in Makefile.am so it will work with
    automake versions earlier than 1.11.1
  Use document name "libpng-manual.txt" instead of "libpng-<version>.txt"
    to simplify version differences.
  Removed obsolete remarks about setjmp handling from INSTALL.
  Revised and renamed the typedef in png.h and png.c that was designed
    to catch library and header mismatch.

Version 1.5.0beta54 [November 10, 2010]
  Require 48 bytes, not 64 bytes, for big_row_buf in overflow checks.
  Used a consistent structure for the pngget.c functions.

Version 1.5.0beta55 [November 21, 2010]
  Revised png_get_uint_32, png_get_int_32, png_get_uint_16 (Cosmin)
  Moved reading of file signature into png_read_sig (Cosmin)
  Fixed atomicity of chunk header serialization (Cosmin)
  Added test for io_state in pngtest.c (Cosmin)
  Added "#!/bin/sh" at the top of contrib/pngminim/*/gather.sh scripts.
  Changes to remove gcc warnings (John Bowler)
    Certain optional gcc warning flags resulted in warnings in libpng code.
    With these changes only -Wconversion and -Wcast-qual cannot be turned on.
    Changes are trivial rearrangements of code.  -Wconversion is not possible
    for pngrutil.c (because of the widespread use of += et al on variables
    smaller than (int) or (unsigned int)) and -Wcast-qual is not possible
    with pngwio.c and pngwutil.c because the 'write' callback and zlib
    compression both fail to declare their input buffers with 'const'.

Version 1.5.0beta56 [December 7, 2010]
  Added the private PNG_UNUSED() macro definition in pngpriv.h.
  Added some commentary about PNG_EXPORT in png.h and pngconf.h
  Revised PNG_EXPORT() macro and added PNG_EXPORTA() macro, with the
    objective of simplifying and improving the cosmetic appearance of png.h.
  Fixed some incorrect "=" macro names in pnglibconf.dfa
  Included documentation of changes in 1.5.0 from 1.4.x in libpng-manual.txt

Version 1.5.0beta57 [December 9, 2010]
  Documented the pngvalid gamma error summary with additional comments and
    print statements.
  Improved missing symbol handling in checksym.awk; symbols missing in both
    the old and new files can now be optionally ignored, treated as errors
    or warnings.
  Removed references to pngvcrd.c and pnggccrd.c from the vstudio project.
  Updated "libpng14" to "libpng15" in the visualc71 project.
  Enabled the strip16 tests in pngvalid.`
  Don't display test results (except PASS/FAIL) when running "make test".
    Instead put them in pngtest-log.txt
  Added "--with-zprefix=<string>" to configure.ac
  Updated the prebuilt configuration files to autoconf version 2.68

Version 1.5.0beta58 [December 19, 2010]
  Fixed interlace image handling and add test cases (John Bowler)
  Fixed the clean rule in Makefile.am to remove pngtest-log.txt
  Made minor changes to work around warnings in gcc 3.4

Version 1.5.0rc01 [December 27, 2010]
  No changes.

Version 1.5.0rc02 [December 27, 2010]
  Eliminated references to the scripts/*.def files in project/visualc71.

Version 1.5.0rc03 [December 28, 2010]
  Eliminated scripts/*.def and revised Makefile.am accordingly

Version 1.5.0rc04 [December 29, 2010]
  Fixed bug in background transformation handling in pngrtran.c (it was
    looking for the flag in png_ptr->transformations instead of in
    png_ptr->flags) (David Raymond).

Version 1.5.0rc05 [December 31, 2010]
  Fixed typo in a comment in CMakeLists.txt (libpng14 => libpng15) (Cosmin)

Version 1.5.0rc06 [January 4, 2011]
  Changed the new configure option "zprefix=string" to "zlib-prefix=string"

Version 1.5.0rc07 [January 4, 2011]
  Updated copyright year.

Version 1.5.0 [January 6, 2011]
  No changes.

version 1.5.1beta01 [January 8, 2011]
  Added description of png_set_crc_action() to the manual.
  Added a note in the manual that the type of the iCCP profile was changed
    from png_charpp to png_bytepp in png_get_iCCP().  This change happened
    in version 1.5.0beta36 but is not noted in the CHANGES.  Similarly,
    it was changed from png_charpp to png_const_bytepp in png_set_iCCP().
  Ensure that png_rgb_to_gray ignores palette mapped images, if libpng
    internally happens to call it with one, and fixed a failure to handle
    palette mapped images correctly.  This fixes CVE-2690.

Version 1.5.1beta02 [January 14, 2011]
  Fixed a bug in handling of interlaced images (bero at arklinux.org).
  Updated CMakeLists.txt (Clifford Yapp)

Version 1.5.1beta03 [January 14, 2011]
  Fixed typecasting of some png_debug() statements (Cosmin)

Version 1.5.1beta04 [January 16, 2011]
  Updated documentation of png_set|get_tRNS() (Thomas Klausner).
  Mentioned in the documentation that applications must #include "zlib.h"
    if they need access to anything in zlib.h, and that a number of
    macros such as png_memset() are no longer accessible by applications.
  Corrected pngvalid gamma test "sample" function to access all of the color
    samples of each pixel, instead of sampling the red channel three times.
  Prefixed variable names index, div, exp, gamma with "png_" to avoid "shadow"
    warnings, and (mistakenly) changed png_exp() to exp().

Version 1.5.1beta05 [January 16, 2011]
  Changed variable names png_index, png_div, png_exp, and png_gamma to
    char_index, divisor, exp_b10, and gamma_val, respectively, and
    changed exp() back to png_exp().

Version 1.5.1beta06 [January 20, 2011]
  Prevent png_push_crc_skip() from hanging while reading an unknown chunk
    or an over-large compressed zTXt chunk with the progressive reader.
  Eliminated more GCC "shadow" warnings.
  Revised png_fixed() in png.c to avoid compiler warning about reaching the
    end without returning anything.

Version 1.5.1beta07 [January 22, 2011]
  In the manual, describe the png_get_IHDR() arguments in the correct order.
  Added const_png_structp and const_png_infop types, and used them in
    prototypes for most png_get_*() functions.

Version 1.5.1beta08 [January 23, 2011]
  Added png_get_io_chunk_type() and deprecated png_get_io_chunk_name()
  Added synopses for the IO_STATE functions and other missing synopses
    to the manual. Removed the synopses from libpngpf.3 because they
    were out of date and no longer useful.  Better information can be
    obtained by reading the prototypes and comments in pngpriv.h
  Attempted to fix cpp on Solaris with S. Studio 12 cc, fix build
    Added a make macro DFNCPP that is a CPP that will accept the tokens in
    a .dfn file and adds configure stuff to test for such a CPP.  ./configure
    should fail if one is not available.
  Corrected const_png_ in png.h to png_const_ to avoid polluting the namespace.
  Added png_get_current_row_number and png_get_current_pass_number for the
    benefit of the user transform callback.
  Added png_process_data_pause and png_process_data_skip for the benefit of
    progressive readers that need to stop data processing or want to optimize
    skipping of unread data (e.g., if the reader marks a chunk to be skipped.)

Version 1.5.1beta09 [January 24, 2011]
  Enhanced pngvalid, corrected an error in gray_to_rgb, corrected doc error.
    pngvalid contains tests of transforms, which tests are currently disabled
    because they are incompletely tested.  gray_to_rgb was failing to expand
    the bit depth for smaller bit depth images; this seems to be a long
    standing error and resulted, apparently, in invalid output
    (CVE-2011-0408, CERT VU#643140).  The documentation did not accurately
    describe what libpng really does when converting RGB to gray.

Version 1.5.1beta10 [January 27, 2010]
  Fixed incorrect examples of callback prototypes in the manual, that were
    introduced in libpng-1.0.0.
  In addition the order of the png_get_uint macros with respect to the
    relevant function definitions has been reversed.  This helps the
    preprocessing of the symbol files be more robust.  Furthermore, the
    symbol file preprocessing now uses -DPNG_NO_USE_READ_MACROS even when
    the library may actually be built with PNG_USE_READ_MACROS; this stops
    the read macros interfering with the symbol file format.
  Made the manual, synopses, and function prototypes use the function
    argument names file_gamma, int_file_gamma, and srgb_intent consistently.

Version 1.5.1beta11 [January 28, 2011]
  Changed PNG_UNUSED from "param=param;" to "{if(param){}}".
  Corrected local variable type in new API png_process_data_skip()
    The type was self-evidently incorrect but only causes problems on 64-bit
    architectures.
  Added transform tests to pngvalid and simplified the arguments.

Version 1.5.1rc01 [January 29, 2011]
  No changes.

Version 1.5.1rc02 [January 31, 2011]
  Added a request in the manual that applications do not use "png_" or
    "PNG_" to begin any of their own symbols.
  Changed PNG_UNUSED to "(void)param;" and updated the commentary in pngpriv.h

Version 1.5.1 [February 3, 2011]
  No changes.

Version 1.5.2beta01 [February 13, 2011]
  More -Wshadow fixes for older gcc compilers.  Older gcc versions apparently
    check formal parameters names in function declarations (as well as
    definitions) to see if they match a name in the global namespace.
  Revised PNG_EXPORTA macro to not use an empty parameter, to accommodate the
    old VisualC++ preprocessor.
  Turned on interlace handling in png_read_png().
  Fixed gcc pendantic warnings.
  Handle longjmp in Cygwin.
  Fixed png_get_current_row_number() in the interlaced case.
  Cleaned up ALPHA flags and transformations.
  Implemented expansion to 16 bits.

Version 1.5.2beta02 [February 19, 2011]
  Fixed mistake in the descriptions of user read_transform and write_transform
    function prototypes in the manual.  The row_info struct is png_row_infop.
  Reverted png_get_current_row_number() to previous (1.5.2beta01) behavior.
  Corrected png_get_current_row_number documentation
  Fixed the read/write row callback documentation.
    This documents the current behavior, where the callback is called after
    every row with information pertaining to the next row.

Version 1.5.2beta03 [March 3, 2011]
  Fixed scripts/makefile.vcwin32
  Updated contrib/pngsuite/README to add the word "modify".
  Define PNG_ALLOCATED to blank when _MSC_VER<1300.

Version 1.5.2rc01 [March 19, 2011]
  Define remaining attributes to blank when MSC_VER<1300.
  ifdef out mask arrays in pngread.c when interlacing is not supported.

Version 1.5.2rc02 [March 22, 2011]
  Added a hint to try CPP=/bin/cpp if "cpp -E" fails in scripts/pnglibconf.mak
    and in contrib/pngminim/*/makefile, eg., on SunOS 5.10, and removed "strip"
    from the makefiles.
  Fixed a bug (present since libpng-1.0.7) that makes png_handle_sPLT() fail
    to compile when PNG_NO_POINTER_INDEXING is defined (Chubanov Kirill)

Version 1.5.2rc03 [March 24, 2011]
  Don't include standard header files in png.h while building the symbol table,
    to avoid cpp failure on SunOS (introduced PNG_BUILDING_SYMBOL_TABLE macro).

Version 1.5.2 [March 31, 2011]
  No changes.

Version 1.5.3beta01 [April 1, 2011]
  Re-initialize the zlib compressor before compressing non-IDAT chunks.
  Added API functions (png_set_text_compression_level() and four others) to
    set parameters for zlib compression of non-IDAT chunks.

Version 1.5.3beta02 [April 3, 2011]
  Updated scripts/symbols.def with new API functions.
  Only compile the new zlib re-initializing code when text or iCCP is
    supported, using PNG_WRITE_COMPRESSED_TEXT_SUPPORTED macro.
  Improved the optimization of the zlib CMF byte (see libpng-1.2.6beta03).
  Optimize the zlib CMF byte in non-IDAT compressed chunks

Version 1.5.3beta03 [April 16, 2011]
  Fixed gcc -ansi -pedantic compile. A strict ANSI system does not have
    snprintf, and the "__STRICT_ANSI__" detects that condition more reliably
    than __STDC__ (John Bowler).
  Removed the PNG_PTR_NORETURN attribute because it too dangerous. It tells
    the compiler that a user supplied callback (the error handler) does not
    return, yet there is no guarantee in practice that the application code
    will correctly implement the error handler because the compiler only
    issues a warning if there is a mistake (John Bowler).
  Removed the no-longer-used PNG_DEPSTRUCT macro.
  Updated the zlib version to 1.2.5 in the VStudio project.
  Fixed 64-bit builds where png_uint_32 is smaller than png_size_t in
    pngwutil.c (John Bowler).
  Fixed bug with stripping the filler or alpha channel when writing, that
    was introduced in libpng-1.5.2beta01 (bug report by Andrew Church).

Version 1.5.3beta04 [April 27, 2011]
  Updated pngtest.png with the new zlib CMF optimization.
  Cleaned up conditional compilation code and of background/gamma handling
    Internal changes only except a new option to avoid compiling the
    png_build_grayscale_palette API (which is not used at all internally.)
    The main change is to move the transform tests (READ_TRANSFORMS,
    WRITE_TRANSFORMS) up one level to the caller of the APIs.  This avoids
    calls to spurious functions if all transforms are disabled and slightly
    simplifies those functions.  Pngvalid modified to handle this.
    A minor change is to stop the strip_16 and expand_16 interfaces from
    disabling each other; this allows the future alpha premultiplication
    code to use 16-bit intermediate values while still producing 8-bit output.
    png_do_background and png_do_gamma have been simplified to take a single
    pointer to the png_struct rather than pointers to every item required
    from the png_struct. This makes no practical difference to the internal
    code.
  A serious bug in the pngvalid internal routine 'standard_display_init' has
    been fixed - this failed to initialize the red channel and accidentally
    initialized the alpha channel twice.
  Changed png_struct jmp_buf member name from png_jmpbuf to tmp_jmpbuf to
    avoid a possible clash with the png_jmpbuf macro on some platforms.

Version 1.5.3beta05 [May 6, 2011]
  Added the "_POSIX_SOURCE" feature test macro to ensure libpng sees the
    correct API. _POSIX_SOURCE is defined in pngpriv.h, pngtest.c and
    pngvalid.c to ensure that POSIX conformant systems disable non-POSIX APIs.
  Removed png_snprintf and added formatted warning messages.  This change adds
    internal APIs to allow png_warning messages to have parameters without
    requiring the host OS to implement snprintf.  As a side effect the
    dependency of the tIME-supporting RFC1132 code on stdio is removed and
    PNG_NO_WARNINGS does actually work now.
  Pass "" instead of '\0' to png_default_error() in png_err().  This mistake
    was introduced in libpng-1.2.20beta01.  This fixes CVE-2011-2691.
  Added PNG_WRITE_OPTIMIZE_CMF_SUPPORTED macro to make the zlib "CMF" byte
    optimization configureable.
  IDAT compression failed if preceded by a compressed text chunk (bug
    introduced in libpng-1.5.3beta01-02).  This was because the attempt to
    reset the zlib stream in png_write_IDAT happened after the first IDAT
    chunk had been deflated - much too late.  In this change internal
    functions were added to claim/release the z_stream and, hopefully, make
    the code more robust.  Also deflateEnd checking is added - previously
    libpng would ignore an error at the end of the stream.

Version 1.5.3beta06 [May 8, 2011]
  Removed the -D_ALL_SOURCE from definitions for AIX in CMakeLists.txt
  Implemented premultiplied alpha support: png_set_alpha_mode API

Version 1.5.3beta07 [May 11, 2011]
  Added expand_16 support to the high level interface.
  Added named value and 'flag' gamma support to png_set_gamma.  Made a minor
    change from the previous (unreleased) ABI/API to hide the exact value used
    for Macs - it's not a good idea to embed this in the ABI!
  Moved macro definitions for PNG_HAVE_IHDR, PNG_HAVE_PLTE, and PNG_AFTER_IDAT
    from pngpriv.h to png.h because they must be visible to applications
    that call png_set_unknown_chunks().
  Check for up->location !PNG_AFTER_IDAT when writing unknown chunks
    before IDAT.

Version 1.5.3beta08 [May 16, 2011]
  Improved "pngvalid --speed" to exclude more of pngvalid from the time.
  Documented png_set_alpha_mode(), other changes in libpng.3/libpng-manual.txt
  The cHRM chunk now sets the defaults for png_set_rgb_to_gray() (when negative
    parameters are supplied by the caller), while in the absence of cHRM
    sRGB/Rec 709 values are still used.  This introduced a divide-by-zero
    bug in png_handle_cHRM().
  The bKGD chunk no longer overwrites the background value set by
    png_set_background(), allowing the latter to be used before the file
    header is read. It never performed any useful function to override
    the default anyway.
  Added memory overwrite and palette image checks to pngvalid.c
    Previously palette image code was poorly checked. Since the transformation
    code has a special palette path in most cases this was a severe weakness.
  Minor cleanup and some extra checking in pngrutil.c and pngrtran.c. When
    expanding an indexed image, always expand to RGBA if transparency is
    present.

Version 1.5.3beta09 [May 17, 2011]
  Reversed earlier 1.5.3 change of transformation order; move png_expand_16
    back where it was.  The change doesn't work because it requires 16-bit
    gamma tables when the code only generates 8-bit ones.  This fails
    silently; the libpng code just doesn't do any gamma correction.  Moving
    the tests back leaves the old, inaccurate, 8-bit gamma calculations, but
    these are clearly better than none!

Version 1.5.3beta10 [May 20, 2011]

  png_set_background() and png_expand_16() did not work together correctly.
    This problem is present in 1.5.2; if png_set_background is called with
    need_expand false and the matching 16 bit color libpng erroneously just
    treats it as an 8-bit color because of where png_do_expand_16 is in the
    transform list.  This simple fix reduces the supplied colour to 8-bits,
    so it gets smashed, but this is better than the current behavior.
  Added tests for expand16, more fixes for palette image tests to pngvalid.
    Corrects the code for palette image tests and disables attempts to
    validate palette colors.

Version 1.5.3rc01 [June 3, 2011]
  No changes.

Version 1.5.3rc02 [June 8, 2011]
  Fixed uninitialized memory read in png_format_buffer() (Bug report by
    Frank Busse, CVE-2011-2501, related to CVE-2004-0421).

Version 1.5.3beta11 [June 11, 2011]
  Fixed png_handle_sCAL which is broken in 1.5. This fixes CVE 2011-2692.
  Added sCAL to pngtest.png
  Revised documentation about png_set_user_limits() to say that it also affects
    png writing.
  Revised handling of png_set_user_limits() so that it can increase the
    limit beyond the PNG_USER_WIDTH|HEIGHT_MAX; previously it could only
    reduce it.
  Make the 16-to-8 scaling accurate. Dividing by 256 with no rounding is
    wrong (high by one) 25% of the time. Dividing by 257 with rounding is
    wrong in 128 out of 65536 cases. Getting the right answer all the time
    without division is easy.
  Added "_SUPPORTED" to the PNG_WRITE_CUSTOMIZE_ZTXT_COMPRESSION macro.
  Added projects/owatcom, an IDE project for OpenWatcom to replace
    scripts/makefile.watcom.  This project works with OpenWatcom 1.9. The
    IDE autogenerates appropriate makefiles (libpng.mk) for batch processing.
    The project is configurable, unlike the Visual Studio project, so long
    as the developer has an awk.
  Changed png_set_gAMA to limit the gamma value range so that the inverse
    of the stored value cannot overflow the fixed point representation,
    and changed other things OpenWatcom warns about.
  Revised pngvalid.c to test PNG_ALPHA_MODE_SUPPORTED correctly. This allows
    pngvalid to build when ALPHA_MODE is not supported, which is required if
    it is to build on libpng 1.4.
  Removed string/memory macros that are no longer used and are not
    necessarily fully supportable, particularly png_strncpy and png_snprintf.
  Added log option to pngvalid.c and attempted to improve gamma messages.

Version 1.5.3 [omitted]
  People found the presence of a beta release following an rc release
    to be confusing; therefore we bump the version to libpng-1.5.4beta01
    and there will be no libpng-1.5.3 release.

Version 1.5.4beta01 [June 14, 2011]
  Made it possible to undefine PNG_READ_16_TO_8_ACCURATE_SCALE_SUPPORTED
    to get the same (inaccurate) output as libpng-1.5.2 and earlier.
  Moved definitions of PNG_HAVE_IHDR, PNG_AFTER_IDAT, and PNG_HAVE_PLTE
    outside of an unknown-chunk block in png.h because they are also
    needed for other uses.

Version 1.5.4beta02 [June 14, 2011]
  Fixed and clarified LEGACY 16-to-8 scaling code.
  Added png_set_chop_16() API, to match inaccurate results from previous
    libpng versions.
  Removed the ACCURATE and LEGACY options (they are no longer useable)
  Use the old scaling method for background if png_set_chop_16() was
    called.
  Made png_set_chop_16() API removeable by disabling PNG_CHOP_16_TO_8_SUPPORTED

Version 1.5.4beta03 [June 15, 2011]
  Fixed a problem in png_do_expand_palette() exposed by optimization in
    1.5.3beta06
  Also removed a spurious and confusing "trans" member ("trans") from png_info.
  The palette expand optimization prevented expansion to an intermediate RGBA
    form if tRNS was present but alpha was marked to be stripped; this exposed
    a check for tRNS in png_do_expand_palette() which is inconsistent with the
    code elsewhere in libpng.
  Correction to the expand_16 code; removed extra instance of
    png_set_scale_16_to_8 from pngpriv.h

Version 1.5.4beta04 [June 16, 2011]
  Added a missing "#ifdef PNG_READ_BACKGROUND_SUPPORTED/#endif" in pngrtran.c
  Added PNG_TRANSFORM_CHOP_16 to the high-level read transforms.
  Made PNG_READ_16_TO_8_ACCURATE_SCALE configurable again.  If this is
    not enabled, png_set_strip_16() and png_do_scale_16_to_8() aren't built.
  Revised contrib/visupng, gregbook, and pngminim to demonstrate chop_16_to_8

Version 1.5.4beta05 [June 16, 2011]
  Renamed png_set_strip_16() to png_set_scale_16() and renamed
    png_set_chop_16() to png_set_strip(16) in an attempt to minimize the
    behavior changes between libpng14 and libpng15.

Version 1.5.4beta06 [June 18, 2011]
  Fixed new bug that was causing both strip_16 and scale_16 to be applied.

Version 1.5.4beta07 [June 19, 2011]
  Fixed pngvalid, simplified macros, added checking for 0 in sCAL.
    The ACCURATE scale macro is no longer defined in 1.5 - call the
    png_scale_16_to_8 API.  Made sure that PNG_READ_16_TO_8 is still defined
    if the png_strip_16_to_8 API is present.  png_check_fp_number now
    maintains some state so that positive, negative and zero values are
    identified.  sCAL uses these to be strictly spec conformant.

Version 1.5.4beta08 [June 23, 2011]
  Fixed pngvalid if ACCURATE_SCALE is defined.
  Updated scripts/pnglibconf.h.prebuilt.

Version 1.5.4rc01 [June 30, 2011]
  Define PNG_ALLOCATED to "restrict" only if MSC_VER >= 1400.

Version 1.5.4 [July 7, 2011]
  No changes.

Version 1.5.5beta01 [July 13, 2011]
  Fixed some typos and made other minor changes in the manual.
  Updated contrib/pngminus/makefile.std (Samuli Souminen)

Version 1.5.5beta02 [July 14, 2011]
  Revised Makefile.am and Makefile.in to look in the right directory for
    pnglibconf.h.prebuilt

Version 1.5.5beta03 [July 27, 2011]
  Enabled compilation with g++ compiler.  This compiler does not recognize
    the file extension, so it always compiles with C++ rules.  Made minor
    changes to pngrutil.c to cast results where C++ expects it but C does not.
  Minor editing of libpng.3 and libpng-manual.txt.

Version 1.5.5beta04 [July 29, 2011]
  Revised CMakeLists.txt (Clifford Yapp)
  Updated commentary about the png_rgb_to_gray() default coefficients
    in the manual and in pngrtran.c

Version 1.5.5beta05 [August 17, 2011]
  Prevent unexpected API exports from non-libpng DLLs on Windows.  The "_DLL"
    is removed from the test of whether a DLL is being built (this erroneously
    caused the libpng APIs to be marked as DLL exports in static builds under
    Microsoft Visual Studio).  Almost all of the libpng building configuration
    is moved from pngconf.h to pngpriv.h, but PNG_DLL_EXPORT remains in
    pngconf.h, though, so that it is colocated with the import definition (it
    is no longer used anywhere in the installed headers).  The VStudio project
    definitions have been cleaned up: "_USRDLL" has been removed from the
    static library builds (this was incorrect), and PNG_USE_DLL has been added
    to pngvalid to test the functionality (pngtest does not supply it,
    deliberately).  The spurious "_EXPORTS" has been removed from the
    libpng build (all these errors were a result of copy/paste between project
    configurations.)
  Added new types and internal functions for CIE RGB end point handling to
    pngpriv.h (functions yet to be implemented).

Version 1.5.5beta06 [August 26, 2011]
  Ensure the CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY is set in CMakeLists.txt
    (Clifford Yap)
  Fixes to rgb_to_gray and cHRM XYZ APIs (John Bowler):
    The rgb_to_gray code had errors when combined with gamma correction.
    Some pixels were treated as true grey when they weren't and such pixels
    and true grey ones were not gamma corrected (the original value of the
    red component was used instead).  APIs to get and set cHRM using color
    space end points have been added and the rgb_to_gray code that defaults
    based on cHRM, and the divide-by-zero bug in png_handle_cHRM (CERT
    VU#477046, CVE-2011-3328, introduced in 1.5.4) have been corrected.
  A considerable number of tests has been added to pngvalid for the
    rgb_to_gray transform.
  Arithmetic errors in rgb_to_gray whereby the calculated gray value was
    truncated to the bit depth rather than rounded have been fixed except in
    the 8-bit non-gamma-corrected case (where consistency seems more important
    than correctness.)  The code still has considerable inaccuracies in the
    8-bit case because 8-bit linear arithmetic is used.

Version 1.5.5beta07 [September 7, 2011]
  Added "$(ARCH)" option to makefile.darwin
  Added SunOS support to configure.ac and Makefile.am
  Changed png_chunk_benign_error() to png_warning() in png.c, in
    png_XYZ_from_xy_checked().

Version 1.5.5beta08 [September 10, 2011]
  Fixed 64-bit compilation errors (gcc). The errors fixed relate
    to conditions where types that are 32 bits in the GCC 32-bit
    world (uLong and png_size_t) become 64 bits in the 64-bit
    world.  This produces potential truncation errors which the
    compiler correctly flags.
  Relocated new HAVE_SOLARIS_LD definition in configure.ac
  Constant changes for 64-bit compatibility (removal of L suffixes). The
    16-bit cases still use "L" as we don't have a 16-bit test system.

Version 1.5.5rc01 [September 15, 2011]
  Removed "L" suffixes in pngpriv.h

Version 1.5.5 [September 22, 2011]
  No changes.

Version 1.5.6beta01 [September 22, 2011]
  Fixed some 64-bit type conversion warnings in pngrtran.c
  Moved row_info from png_struct to a local variable.
  The various interlace mask arrays have been made into arrays of
    bytes and made PNG_CONST and static (previously some arrays were
    marked PNG_CONST and some weren't).
  Additional checks have been added to the transform code to validate the
    pixel depths after the transforms on both read and write.
  Removed some redundant code from pngwrite.c, in png_destroy_write_struct().
  Changed chunk reading/writing code to use png_uint_32 instead of png_byte[4].
    This removes the need to allocate temporary strings for chunk names on
    the stack in the read/write code.  Unknown chunk handling still uses the
    string form because this is exposed in the API.

Version 1.5.6beta02 [September 26, 2011]
  Added a note in the manual the png_read_update_info() must be called only
    once with a particular info_ptr.
  Fixed a typo in the definition of the new PNG_STRING_FROM_CHUNK(s,c) macro.

Version 1.5.6beta03 [September 28, 2011]
  Revised test-pngtest.sh to report FAIL when pngtest fails.
  Added "--strict" option to pngtest, to report FAIL when the failure is
    only because the resulting valid files are different.
  Revised CMakeLists.txt to work with mingw and removed some material from
    CMakeLists.txt that is no longer useful in libpng-1.5.

Version 1.5.6beta04 [October 5, 2011]
  Fixed typo in Makefile.in and Makefile.am ("-M Wl" should be "-M -Wl")."

Version 1.5.6beta05 [October 12, 2011]
  Speed up png_combine_row() for interlaced images. This reduces the generality
    of the code, allowing it to be optimized for Adam7 interlace.  The masks
    passed to png_combine_row() are now generated internally, avoiding
    some code duplication and localizing the interlace handling somewhat.
  Align png_struct::row_buf - previously it was always unaligned, caused by
    a bug in the code that attempted to align it; the code needs to subtract
    one from the pointer to take account of the filter byte prepended to
    each row.
  Optimized png_combine_row() when rows are aligned. This gains a small
    percentage for 16-bit and 32-bit pixels in the typical case where the
    output row buffers are appropriately aligned. The optimization was not
    previously possible because the png_struct buffer was always misaligned.
  Fixed bug in png_write_chunk_header() debug print, introduced in 1.5.6beta01.

Version 1.5.6beta06 [October 17, 2011]
  Removed two redundant tests for unitialized row.
  Fixed a relatively harmless memory overwrite in compressed text writing
    with a 1 byte zlib buffer.
  Add ability to call png_read_update_info multiple times to pngvalid.c.
  Fixes for multiple calls to png_read_update_info. These fixes attend to
    most of the errors revealed in pngvalid, however doing the gamma work
    twice results in inaccuracies that can't be easily fixed.  There is now
    a warning in the code if this is going to happen.
  Turned on multiple png_read_update_info in pngvalid transform tests.
  Prevent libpng from overwriting unused bits at the end of the image when
    it is not byte aligned, while reading. Prior to libpng-1.5.6 libpng would
    overwrite the partial byte at the end of each row if the row width was not
    an exact multiple of 8 bits and the image is not interlaced.

Version 1.5.6beta07 [October 21, 2011]
  Made png_ptr->prev_row an aligned pointer into png_ptr->big_prev_row
    (Mans Rullgard).

Version 1.5.6rc01 [October 26, 2011]
  Changed misleading "Missing PLTE before cHRM" warning to "Out of place cHRM"

Version 1.5.6rc02 [October 27, 2011]
  Added LSR() macro to defend against buggy compilers that evaluate non-taken
    code branches and complain about out-of-range shifts.

Version 1.5.6rc03 [October 28, 2011]
  Renamed the LSR() macro to PNG_LSR() and added PNG_LSL() macro.
  Fixed compiler warnings with Intel and MSYS compilers. The logical shift
    fix for Microsoft Visual C is required by other compilers, so this
    enables that fix for all compilers when using compile-time constants.
    Under MSYS 'byte' is a name declared in a system header file, so we
    changed the name of a local variable to avoid the warnings that result.
  Added #define PNG_ALIGN_TYPE PNG_ALIGN_NONE to contrib/pngminim/*/pngusr.h

Version 1.5.6 [November 3, 2011]
  No changes.

Version 1.5.7beta01 [November 4, 2011]
  Added support for ARM processor (Mans Rullgard)
  Fixed bug in pngvalid on early allocation failure; fixed type cast in
    pngmem.c; pngvalid would attempt to call png_error() if the allocation
    of a png_struct or png_info failed. This would probably have led to a
    crash.  The pngmem.c implementation of png_malloc() included a cast
    to png_size_t which would fail on large allocations on 16-bit systems.
  Fix for the preprocessor of the Intel C compiler. The preprocessor
    splits adjacent @ signs with a space; this changes the concatentation
    token from @-@-@ to PNG_JOIN; that should work with all compiler
    preprocessors.
  Paeth filter speed improvements from work by Siarhei Siamashka. This
    changes the 'Paeth' reconstruction function to improve the GCC code
    generation on x86. The changes are only part of the suggested ones;
    just the changes that definitely improve speed and remain simple.
    The changes also slightly increase the clarity of the code.

Version 1.5.7beta02 [November 11, 2011]
  Check compression_type parameter in png_get_iCCP and remove spurious
    casts. The compression_type parameter is always assigned to, so must
    be non-NULL. The cast of the profile length potentially truncated the
    value unnecessarily on a 16-bit int system, so the cast of the (byte)
    compression type to (int) is specified by ANSI-C anyway.
  Fixed FP division by zero in pngvalid.c; the 'test_pixel' code left
    the sBIT fields in the test pixel as 0, which resulted in a floating
    point division by zero which was irrelevant but causes systems where
    FP exceptions cause a crash. Added code to pngvalid to turn on FP
    exceptions if the appropriate glibc support is there to ensure this is
    tested in the future.
  Updated scripts/pnglibconf.mak and scripts/makefile.std to handle the
    new PNG_JOIN macro.
  Added versioning to pnglibconf.h comments.
  Simplified read/write API initial version; basic read/write tested on
    a variety of images, limited documentation (in the header file.)
  Installed more accurate linear to sRGB conversion tables. The slightly
    modified tables reduce the number of 16-bit values that
    convert to an off-by-one 8-bit value.  The "makesRGB.c" code that was used
    to generate the tables is now in a contrib/sRGBtables sub-directory.

Version 1.5.7beta03 [November 17, 2011]
  Removed PNG_CONST from the sRGB table declarations in pngpriv.h and png.c
  Added run-time detection of NEON support.
  Added contrib/libtests; includes simplified API test and timing test and
    a color conversion utility for rapid checking of failed 'pngstest' results.
  Multiple transform bug fixes plus a work-round for double gamma correction.
    libpng does not support more than one transform that requires linear data
    at once - if this is tried typically the results is double gamma
    correction. Since the simplified APIs can need rgb to gray combined with
    a compose operation it is necessary to do one of these outside the main
    libpng transform code. This check-in also contains fixes to various bugs
    in the simplified APIs themselves and to some bugs in compose and rgb to
    gray (on palette) itself.
  Fixes for C++ compilation using g++ When libpng source is compiled
    using g++. The compiler imposes C++ rules on the C source; thus it
    is desireable to make the source work with either C or C++ rules
    without throwing away useful error information.  This change adds
    png_voidcast to allow C semantic (void*) cases or the corresponding
    C++ static_cast operation, as appropriate.
  Added --noexecstack to assembler file compilation. GCC does not set
    this on assembler compilation, even though it does on C compilation.
    This creates security issues if assembler code is enabled; the
    work-around is to set it by default in the flags for $(CCAS)
  Work around compilers that don't support declaration of const data. Some
    compilers fault 'extern const' data declarations (because the data is
    not initialized); this turns on const-ness only for compilers where
    this is known to work.

Version 1.5.7beta04 [November 17, 2011]
  Since the gcc driver does not recognize the --noexecstack flag, we must
    use the -Wa prefix to have it passed through to the assembler.
    Also removed a duplicate setting of this flag.
  Added files that were omitted from the libpng-1.5.7beta03 zip distribution.

Version 1.5.7beta05 [November 25, 2011]
  Removed "zTXt" from warning in generic chunk decompression function.
  Validate time settings passed to pngset() and png_convert_to_rfc1123()
    (Frank Busse).
  Added MINGW support to CMakeLists.txt
  Reject invalid compression flag or method when reading the iTXt chunk.
  Backed out 'simplified' API changes. The API seems too complex and there
    is a lack of consensus or enthusiasm for the proposals.  The API also
    reveals significant bugs inside libpng (double gamma correction and the
    known bug of being unable to retrieve a corrected palette). It seems
    better to wait until the bugs, at least, are corrected.
  Moved pngvalid.c into contrib/libtests
  Rebuilt Makefile.in, configure, etc., with autoconf-2.68

Version 1.5.7rc01 [December 1, 2011]
  Replaced an "#if" with "#ifdef" in pngrtran.c
  Revised #if PNG_DO_BC block in png.c (use #ifdef and add #else)

Version 1.5.7rc02 [December 5, 2011]
  Revised project files and contrib/pngvalid/pngvalid.c to account for
    the relocation of pngvalid into contrib/libtests.
  Revised pngconf.h to use " __declspec(restrict)" only when MSC_VER >= 1400,
    as in libpng-1.5.4.
  Put CRLF line endings in the owatcom project files.

Version 1.5.7rc03 [December 7, 2011]
  Updated CMakeLists.txt to account for the relocation of pngvalid.c

Version 1.5.7 [December 15, 2011]
  Minor fixes to pngvalid.c for gcc 4.6.2 compatibility to remove warnings
    reported by earlier versions.

Version 1.5.8beta01 [January 15, 2011]
  Removed '#include config.h"' from contrib/libtests/pngvalid.c.  It's not
    needed and causes trouble for VPATH building.
  Moved AC_MSG_CHECKING([if libraries can be versioned]) later to the proper
    location in configure.ac (Gilles Espinasse).
  Fix bug in pngerror.c: some long warnings were being improperly truncated
    (CVE-2011-3464, bug introduced in libpng-1.5.3beta05).

Version 1.5.8rc01 [January 21, 2012]
  No changes.

Version 1.5.8rc02 [January 25, 2012]
  Fixed Min/GW uninstall to remove libpng.dll.a
  Conditionalize the install rules for MINGW and CYGWIN in CMakeLists.txt

Version 1.5.8 [February 1, 2012]
  No changes.

Version 1.5.9beta01 [February 3, 2012]
  Rebuilt configure scripts in the tar distributions.

Version 1.5.9beta02 [February 16, 2012]
  Removed two unused definitions from scripts/pnglibconf.h.prebuilt
  Removed some unused arrays (with #ifdef) from png_read_push_finish_row().
  Removed tests for no-longer-used *_EMPTY_PLTE_SUPPORTED from pngstruct.h

Version 1.5.9rc01 [February 17, 2012]
  Fixed CVE-2011-3026 buffer overrun bug.  This bug was introduced when
    iCCP chunk support was added at libpng-1.0.6. Deal more correctly with the
    test on iCCP chunk length. Also removed spurious casts that may hide
    problems on 16-bit systems.

Version 1.5.9 [February 18, 2012]
  No changes.

Version 1.5.10beta01 [February 24, 2012]
  Removed two useless #ifdef directives from pngread.c and one from pngrutil.c
  Always put the CMAKE_LIBRARY in "lib" (removed special WIN32 case).
  Removed empty vstudio/pngstest directory (Clifford Yapp).
  Eliminated redundant png_push_read_tEXt|zTXt|iTXt|unknown code from
    pngpread.c and use the sequential png_handle_tEXt, etc., in pngrutil.c;
    now that png_ptr->buffer is inaccessible to applications, the special
    handling is no longer useful.
  Fixed bug with png_handle_hIST with odd chunk length (Frank Busse).
  Added PNG_SAFE_LIMITS feature to pnglibconf.dfa and code in pngconf.h
    to reset the user limits to safe ones if PNG_SAFE_LIMITS is defined.
    To enable, use "CPPFLAGS=-DPNG_SAFE_LIMITS_SUPPORTED" on the configure
    command or put "#define PNG_SAFE_LIMITS_SUPPORTED" in pnglibconf.h.
  Revised the SAFE_LIMITS feature to be the same as the feature in libpng16.
  Added information about the new limits in the manual.

Version 1.5.10beta02 [February 27, 2012]
  Updated Makefile.in

Version 1.5.10beta03 [March 6, 2012]
  Removed unused "current_text" members of png_struct and the png_free()
    of png_ptr->current_text from pngread.c
  Added palette-index checking. Issue a png_warning() if an invalid index is
    found.

Version 1.5.10beta04 [March 10, 2012]
  Fixed PNG_LIBPNG_BUILD_BASE_TYPE definition.
  Fixed CMF optimization of non-IDAT compressed chunks, which was added at
    libpng-1.5.4.  It sometimes produced too small of a window.

Version 1.5.10beta05 [March 10, 2012]
  Reject all iCCP chunks after the first, even if the first one is invalid.
  Issue a png_benign_error() instead of png_warning() about bad palette index.
  Fixed an off-by-one error in the palette index checking function.
  Revised example.c to put text strings in a temporary character array
    instead of directly assigning string constants to png_textp members.
    This avoids compiler warnings when -Wwrite-strings is enabled.

Version 1.5.10 [March 29, 2012]
  Prevent PNG_EXPAND+PNG_SHIFT doing the shift twice.
  Revised png_set_text_2() to avoid potential memory corruption (fixes
    CVE-2011-3048).

Version 1.5.11beta01 [April 28, 2012]
  Revised scripts/makefile.darwin: use system zlib; remove quotes around
    architecture list; add missing ppc architecture; add architecture options
    to shared library link; don't try to create a shared lib based on missing
    RELEASE variable.
  Enable png_set_check_for_invalid_index() for both read and write.
  Removed #ifdef PNG_HANDLE_AS_UNKNOWN_SUPPORTED/#endif in pngpriv.h around
    declaration of png_handle_unknown().
  Added -lssp_nonshared in a comment in scripts/makefile.freebsd
    and changed deprecated NOOBJ and NOPROFILE to NO_OBJ and NO_PROFILE.

Version 1.5.11rc01 [May 23, 2012]
  No changes.

Version 1.5.11rc02 [May 29, 2012]
  Fixed some typos in comments.
  Revised CMakeLists.txt to not attempt to make a symlink under mingw.
  Added two images to contrib/pngsuite (1-bit and 2-bit transparent grayscale),
    and renamed three whose names were inconsistent with those in
    pngsuite/README.txt.

Version 1.5.11rc03 [June 4, 2012]
  Do not depend upon a GCC feature macro being available for use in generating
    the linker mapfile symbol prefix.
  Made fixes for new optimization warnings from gcc 4.7.0. The compiler
    performed an optimization which is safe but then warned about it.
    Changing the type of 'palette_number' in pngvalid.c removes the warning.

Version 1.5.11rc04 [June 6, 2012]
  Improved performance of new do_check_palette_indexes() function.

Version 1.5.11rc05 [June 7, 2012]
  Don't check palette indexes if num_palette is 0 (as it can be in MNG files).

Version 1.5.11 [June 14, 2012]
  Include zlib.h in contrib/gregbook and contrib/visupng examples.

Version 1.5.12 [July 11, 2012]
  Removed scripts/makefile.cegcc from the *.zip and *.7z distributions; it
    depends on configure, which is not included in those archives.
  Changed "a+w" to "u+w" in Makefile.in to fix CVE-2012-3386.
