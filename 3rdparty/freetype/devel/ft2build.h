  * debug mode.  Its only difference to the default version is that it
  * includes a local `ftoption.h' header file with different settings for
  * many configuration macros.
  *
  * To use it, simply ensure that the directory containing this file is
  * scanned by the compiler before the default FreeType header directory.
