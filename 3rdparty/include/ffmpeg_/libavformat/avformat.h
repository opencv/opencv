/**
 * @defgroup libavf I/O and Muxing/Demuxing Library
 * @{
 *
 * Libavformat (lavf) is a library for dealing with various media container
 * formats. Its main two purposes are demuxing - i.e. splitting a media file
 * into component streams, and the reverse process of muxing - writing supplied
 * data in a specified container format. It also has an @ref lavf_io
 * "I/O module" which supports a number of protocols for accessing the data (e.g.
 * file, tcp, http and others). Before using lavf, you need to call
 * av_register_all() to register all compiled muxers, demuxers and protocols.
 * Unless you are absolutely sure you won't use libavformat's network
 * capabilities, you should also call avformat_network_init().
 *
 * A supported input format is described by an AVInputFormat struct, conversely
 * an output format is described by AVOutputFormat. You can iterate over all
 * registered input/output formats using the av_iformat_next() /
 * av_oformat_next() functions. The protocols layer is not part of the public
 * API, so you can only get the names of supported protocols with the
 * avio_enum_protocols() function.
 *
 * Main lavf structure used for both muxing and demuxing is AVFormatContext,
 * which exports all information about the file being read or written. As with
 * most Libavformat structures, its size is not part of public ABI, so it cannot be
 * allocated on stack or directly with av_malloc(). To create an
 * AVFormatContext, use avformat_alloc_context() (some functions, like
 * avformat_open_input() might do that for you).
 *
 * Most importantly an AVFormatContext contains:
 * @li the @ref AVFormatContext.iformat "input" or @ref AVFormatContext.oformat
 * "output" format. It is either autodetected or set by user for input;
 * always set by user for output.
 * @li an @ref AVFormatContext.streams "array" of AVStreams, which describe all
 * elementary streams stored in the file. AVStreams are typically referred to
 * using their index in this array.
 * @li an @ref AVFormatContext.pb "I/O context". It is either opened by lavf or
 * set by user for input, always set by user for output (unless you are dealing
 * with an AVFMT_NOFILE format).
 *
 * @section lavf_options Passing options to (de)muxers
 * Lavf allows to configure muxers and demuxers using the @ref avoptions
 * mechanism. Generic (format-independent) libavformat options are provided by
 * AVFormatContext, they can be examined from a user program by calling
 * av_opt_next() / av_opt_find() on an allocated AVFormatContext (or its AVClass
 * from avformat_get_class()). Private (format-specific) options are provided by
 * AVFormatContext.priv_data if and only if AVInputFormat.priv_class /
 * AVOutputFormat.priv_class of the corresponding format struct is non-NULL.
 * Further options may be provided by the @ref AVFormatContext.pb "I/O context",
 * if its AVClass is non-NULL, and the protocols layer. See the discussion on
 * nesting in @ref avoptions documentation to learn how to access those.
 *
 * @defgroup lavf_decoding Demuxing
 * @{
 * Demuxers read a media file and split it into chunks of data (@em packets). A
 * @ref AVPacket "packet" contains one or more encoded frames which belongs to a
 * single elementary stream. In the lavf API this process is represented by the
 * avformat_open_input() function for opening a file, av_read_frame() for
 * reading a single packet and finally avformat_close_input(), which does the
 * cleanup.
 *
 * @section lavf_decoding_open Opening a media file
 * The minimum information required to open a file is its URL or filename, which
 * is passed to avformat_open_input(), as in the following code:
 * @code
 * const char    *url = "in.mp3";
 * AVFormatContext *s = NULL;
 * int ret = avformat_open_input(&s, url, NULL, NULL);
 * if (ret < 0)
 *     abort();
 * @endcode
 * The above code attempts to allocate an AVFormatContext, open the
 * specified file (autodetecting the format) and read the header, exporting the
 * information stored there into s. Some formats do not have a header or do not
 * store enough information there, so it is recommended that you call the
 * avformat_find_stream_info() function which tries to read and decode a few
 * frames to find missing information.
 *
 * In some cases you might want to preallocate an AVFormatContext yourself with
 * avformat_alloc_context() and do some tweaking on it before passing it to
 * avformat_open_input(). One such case is when you want to use custom functions
 * for reading input data instead of lavf internal I/O layer.
 * To do that, create your own AVIOContext with avio_alloc_context(), passing
 * your reading callbacks to it. Then set the @em pb field of your
 * AVFormatContext to newly created AVIOContext.
 *
 * Since the format of the opened file is in general not known until after
 * avformat_open_input() has returned, it is not possible to set demuxer private
 * options on a preallocated context. Instead, the options should be passed to
 * avformat_open_input() wrapped in an AVDictionary:
 * @code
 * AVDictionary *options = NULL;
 * av_dict_set(&options, "video_size", "640x480", 0);
 * av_dict_set(&options, "pixel_format", "rgb24", 0);
 *
 * if (avformat_open_input(&s, url, NULL, &options) < 0)
 *     abort();
 * av_dict_free(&options);
 * @endcode
 * This code passes the private options 'video_size' and 'pixel_format' to the
 * demuxer. They would be necessary for e.g. the rawvideo demuxer, since it
 * cannot know how to interpret raw video data otherwise. If the format turns
 * out to be something different than raw video, those options will not be
 * recognized by the demuxer and therefore will not be applied. Such unrecognized
 * options are then returned in the options dictionary (recognized options are
 * consumed). The calling program can handle such unrecognized options as it
 * wishes, e.g.
 * @code
 * AVDictionaryEntry *e;
 * if (e = av_dict_get(options, "", NULL, AV_DICT_IGNORE_SUFFIX)) {
 *     fprintf(stderr, "Option %s not recognized by the demuxer.\n", e->key);
 *     abort();
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * After you have finished reading the file, you must close it with
 * avformat_close_input(). It will free everything associated with the file.
 *
 * @section lavf_decoding_read Reading from an opened file
 * Reading data from an opened AVFormatContext is done by repeatedly calling
 * av_read_frame() on it. Each call, if successful, will return an AVPacket
 * containing encoded data for one AVStream, identified by
 * AVPacket.stream_index. This packet may be passed straight into the libavcodec
 * decoding functions avcodec_decode_video2(), avcodec_decode_audio4() or
 * avcodec_decode_subtitle2() if the caller wishes to decode the data.
 *
 * AVPacket.pts, AVPacket.dts and AVPacket.duration timing information will be
 * set if known. They may also be unset (i.e. AV_NOPTS_VALUE for
 * pts/dts, 0 for duration) if the stream does not provide them. The timing
 * information will be in AVStream.time_base units, i.e. it has to be
 * multiplied by the timebase to convert them to seconds.
 *
 * If AVPacket.buf is set on the returned packet, then the packet is
 * allocated dynamically and the user may keep it indefinitely.
 * Otherwise, if AVPacket.buf is NULL, the packet data is backed by a
 * static storage somewhere inside the demuxer and the packet is only valid
 * until the next av_read_frame() call or closing the file. If the caller
 * requires a longer lifetime, av_dup_packet() will make an av_malloc()ed copy
 * of it.
 * In both cases, the packet must be freed with av_free_packet() when it is no
 * longer needed.

/**
 * @defgroup metadata_api Public Metadata API
 * @{
 * @ingroup libavf
 * The metadata API allows libavformat to export metadata tags to a client
 * application when demuxing. Conversely it allows a client application to
 * set metadata when muxing.
 *
 * Metadata is exported or set as pairs of key/value strings in the 'metadata'
 * fields of the AVFormatContext, AVStream, AVChapter and AVProgram structs
 * using the @ref lavu_dict "AVDictionary" API. Like all strings in FFmpeg,
 * metadata is assumed to be UTF-8 encoded Unicode. Note that metadata
 * exported by demuxers isn't checked to be valid UTF-8 in most cases.
 *
 * Important concepts to keep in mind:
 * -  Keys are unique; there can never be 2 tags with the same key. This is
 *    also meant semantically, i.e., a demuxer should not knowingly produce
 *    several keys that are literally different but semantically identical.
 *    E.g., key=Author5, key=Author6. In this example, all authors must be
 *    placed in the same tag.
 * -  Metadata is flat, not hierarchical; there are no subtags. If you
 *    want to store, e.g., the email address of the child of producer Alice
 *    and actor Bob, that could have key=alice_and_bobs_childs_email_address.
 * -  Several modifiers can be applied to the tag name. This is done by
 *    appending a dash character ('-') and the modifier name in the order
 *    they appear in the list below -- e.g. foo-eng-sort, not foo-sort-eng.
 *    -  language -- a tag whose value is localized for a particular language
 *       is appended with the ISO 639-2/B 3-letter language code.
 *       For example: Author-ger=Michael, Author-eng=Mike
 *       The original/default language is in the unqualified "Author" tag.
 *       A demuxer should set a default if it sets any translated tag.
 *    -  sorting  -- a modified version of a tag that should be used for
 *       sorting will have '-sort' appended. E.g. artist="The Beatles",
 *       artist-sort="Beatles, The".
 *
 * -  Demuxers attempt to export metadata in a generic format, however tags
 *    with no generic equivalents are left as they are stored in the container.
 *    Follows a list of generic tag names:
 *
 @verbatim
 album        -- name of the set this work belongs to
 album_artist -- main creator of the set/album, if different from artist.
                 e.g. "Various Artists" for compilation albums.
 artist       -- main creator of the work
 comment      -- any additional description of the file.
 composer     -- who composed the work, if different from artist.
 copyright    -- name of copyright holder.
 creation_time-- date when the file was created, preferably in ISO 8601.
 date         -- date when the work was created, preferably in ISO 8601.
 disc         -- number of a subset, e.g. disc in a multi-disc collection.
 encoder      -- name/settings of the software/hardware that produced the file.
 encoded_by   -- person/group who created the file.
 filename     -- original name of the file.
 genre        -- <self-evident>.
 language     -- main language in which the work is performed, preferably
                 in ISO 639-2 format. Multiple languages can be specified by
                 separating them with commas.
 performer    -- artist who performed the work, if different from artist.
                 E.g for "Also sprach Zarathustra", artist would be "Richard
                 Strauss" and performer "London Philharmonic Orchestra".
 publisher    -- name of the label/publisher.
 service_name     -- name of the service in broadcasting (channel name).
 service_provider -- name of the service provider in broadcasting.
 title        -- name of the work.
 track        -- number of this work in the set, can be in form current/total.
 variant_bitrate -- the total bitrate of the bitrate variant that the current stream is part of
