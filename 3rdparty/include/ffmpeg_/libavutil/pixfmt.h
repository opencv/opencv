/**
 * Pixel format. Notes:
 *
 * PIX_FMT_RGB32 is handled in an endian-specific manner. An RGBA
 * color is put together as:
 *  (A << 24) | (R << 16) | (G << 8) | B
 * This is stored as BGRA on little-endian CPU architectures and ARGB on
 * big-endian CPUs.
 *
 * When the pixel format is palettized RGB (PIX_FMT_PAL8), the palettized
 * image data is stored in AVFrame.data[0]. The palette is transported in
 * AVFrame.data[1], is 1024 bytes long (256 4-byte entries) and is
 * formatted the same as in PIX_FMT_RGB32 described above (i.e., it is
 * also endian-specific). Note also that the individual RGB palette
 * components stored in AVFrame.data[1] should be in the range 0..255.
 * This is important as many custom PAL8 video codecs that were designed
 * to run on the IBM VGA graphics adapter use 6-bit palette components.
 *
 * For all the 8bit per pixel formats, an RGB32 palette is in data[1] like
 * for pal8. This palette is filled in automatically by the function
 * allocating the picture.
 *
 * Note, make sure that all newly added big endian formats have pix_fmt&1==1
 *       and that all newly added little endian formats have pix_fmt&1==0
 *       this allows simpler detection of big vs little endian.
