     *   - if compression is not successful for a file smaller than 64K, we can
     *     even emit a stored file instead of a stored block (saving 5 bytes).
     *     This is applicable only for zip (not gzip or zlib).
     *   - creating new Huffman trees less frequently may not provide fast
     *     adaptation to changes in the input data statistics. (Take for
     *     example a binary file with poorly compressible code followed by
     *     a highly compressible string table.) Smaller buffer sizes give
     *     fast adaptation but have of course the overhead of transmitting
     *     trees more frequently.
