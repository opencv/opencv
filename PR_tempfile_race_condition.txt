PR Title: Fix tempfile race condition on Windows

Branch: fix/tempfile-race-condition-19648
Issue: #19648

===== DESCRIPTION =====

Summary
Fixes race condition in cv::tempfile() on Windows where multiple processes could receive the same temporary filename.

Problem
The previous implementation used GetTempFileNameA() followed by immediate DeleteFileA(), creating a race condition window where multiple OpenCV processes running simultaneously could get the same filename, causing collisions.

Root Cause
The function called GetTempFileNameA() to generate a temp filename, immediately deleted the file to free the name, then returned the filename string. Between deletion and return, another process could call GetTempFileNameA() and receive the same filename.

Solution
Replaced GetTempFileNameA() with GUID-based filename generation using CoCreateGuid(), following the same approach already used in GetTempFileNameWinRT() and Microsoft's recommendations for scenarios requiring many temp files.

Changes
modules/core/src/system.cpp lines 1110-1124:
- Removed GetTempFileNameA() and DeleteFileA() calls
- Added CoCreateGuid() to generate unique GUID-based filenames
- Format: "ocv{GUID}" where GUID ensures uniqueness across processes

Benefits
- Eliminates race condition in multi-process scenarios
- No file I/O overhead from creating and deleting placeholder files
- Consistent with WinRT implementation approach
- Follows Microsoft best practices

Testing
Standard OpenCV test suite. The change only affects Windows temp file naming and maintains the same String return type and usage pattern.
