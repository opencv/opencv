additional licenses from various entities. Should any such additional licenses
be required, you are solely responsible for obtaining any such licenses and 
agree to obtain any such licenses at your own expense.

ii.	Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, a valid license to Intel
IPP is a prerequisite to any license for Sample Source, and possession of Sample
Source does not grant any license to Intel IPP (or any portion thereof). To 
access Sample Source, you must first register your licensed copy of the Intel 
IPP with Intel. By downloading, installing or copying any Sample Source file, 
you agree to be bound by terms of this Agreement.
