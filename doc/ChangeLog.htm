<h2>2.1</h2>
<p class="Blurb"><i>(April, 2010)</i></p>

<pre>
OpenCV 2.1 is basically a stabilized OpenCV 2.0, yet there are a few new features. 

>>> General modifications

  - SVN repository has been migrated from SourceForge to https://code.ros.org/svn/opencv.
    The bug tracker has been moved to https://code.ros.org/trac/opencv/.
    And we also have OpenCV twitter! http://twitter.com/opencvlibrary 

  - The whole OpenCV is now using exceptions instead of the old libc-style mechanism.
    That is, instead of checking error code with cvGetErrStatus() (which currently always returns 0)
    you can now just call OpenCV functions inside C++ try-catch statements,
    cv::Exception is now derived from std::exception.
  
  - OpenCV does not support autotools-based build scripts,
    CMake (www.cmake.org) is the only way to build OpenCV on any OS.
    See http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/InstallGuide.
    
  - All the parallel loops in OpenCV have been converted from OpenMP
    to Intel TBB (http://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/). Thus parallel version of OpenCV
    can now be built using MSVC 2008 Express Edition or using earlier than 4.2 versions of GCC.
    
  - SWIG-based Python wrappers are still included,
    but they are not built by default and it's generally preferable to use the new wrappers.
    The python samples have been rewritten by James Bowman to use the new-style Python wrappers,
    which have been also created by James.
    
  - OpenCV can now be built and run in 64-bit mode on MacOSX 10.6 and Windows (see HighGUI and known problems below).
    On Windows both MSVC 2008 and mingw64 are known to work.
    
  - In theory OpenCV is now able to determine the host CPU on-fly and make use of SSE/SSE2/... instructions,
    if they are available. That is, it should be more safe to use WITH_SSE* flags in CMake.
    However, if you want maximum portability, it's recommended to turn on just WITH_SSE and WITH_SSE2
    and leave other SSE* turned off, as we found that using WITH_SSE3, WITH_SSSE3 and WITH_SSE4_1 can yield
    the code incompatible with Intel's pre-Penryn or AMD chips.

  - Experimental "static" OpenCV configuration in CMake was contributed by Jose Luis Blanco.
    Pass "BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF" to CMake to build OpenCV statically.   

>>> New functionality, features:

  - cxcore, cv, cvaux:
  
    * Grabcut (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GrabCut) image segmentation algorithm has been implemented.
      See opencv/samples/c/grabcut.cpp
  
    * new improved version of one-way descriptor is added. See opencv/samples/c/one_way_sample.cpp
    
    * modified version of H. Hirschmuller semi-global stereo matching algorithm that we call SGBM
      (semi-global block matching) has been created. It is much faster than Kolmogorov's graph
      cuts-based algorithm and yet it's usually better than the block matching StereoBM algorithm.
      See opencv/samples/c/stereo_matching.cpp.
      
    * existing StereoBM stereo correspondence algorithm by K. Konolige was noticeably improved:
      added the optional left-right consistency check and speckle filtering,
      improved performance (by ~20%).
      
    * User can now control the image areas visible after the stereo rectification
      (see the extended stereoRectify/cvStereoRectify), and also limit the region
      where the disparity is computed (see CvStereoBMState::roi1, roi2; getValidDisparityROI).
      
    * Mixture-of-Gaussian based background subtraction algorithm has been rewritten for better performance
      and better accuracy. Alternative C++ interface BackgroundSubtractor has been provided,
      along with the possibility to use the trained background model to segment the foreground
      without updating the model. See opencv/samples/c/bgfg_segm.cpp.    
      
  - highgui:
    
    * MacOSX: OpenCV now includes Cocoa and QTKit backends, in addition to Carbon and Quicktime.
      Therefore you can build OpenCV as 64-bit library. Thanks to Andre Cohen and Nicolas Butko, which components 
      
      Note however that the backend are now in the alpha state, they can crash or leak memory,
      so for anything more serious than quick experiments you may prefer to use Carbon and Quicktime.
      To do that, pass USE_CARBON=ON and USE_QUICKTIME=ON to CMake and build OpenCV in 32-bit mode
      (i.e. select i386 architecture in Xcode).
      
    * Windows. OpenCV can now be built in 64-bit mode with MSVC 2008 and also mingw64.
      
    * Fullscreen has been added (thanks to Yannick Verdie).
      Call cvSetWindowProperty(window_name, CV_WINDOW_FULLSCREEN, 1) to make the particular window
      to fill the whole screen. This feature is not supported in the Cocoa bindings yet.     
     
    * gstreamer backend has been improved a lot (thanks to Stefano Fabri)     

>>> New tests:

  - A few dozens of new tests have been written and many existing tests have been extended
    to verify OpenCV correctness thoroughly. As a result, we brought the test coverage from
    rather mediocre numbers to pretty impressive ones (especially for cxcore and cv)!
    
    Module                 OpenCV 2.0 coverage                 OpenCV 2.1
                         (functions/conditions)          (functions/conditions)     
    cxcore                      65/54                            91/73
    cv                          52/46                            80/68
    ml                          66/47                            73/52
    highgui                     17/3                             54/27
    cvaux                        0/0                              5/12

  - Many new regression tests have been written in Python that check both OpenCV and the new-style bindings.

  - The test data moved to the separate repository: https://code.ros.org/svn/opencv/trunk/opencv_extra/testdata.
    And it is not included into the package, thus some tests from the cvtest and mltest will report about the missing data.
    You can download the directory to your hard drive and run cvtest like:
    ./cvtest -d <path_to_opencv_extra>/testdata/cv
    ./mltest -d <path_to_opencv_extra>/testdata/ml  
    
  - The test engine has been improved:
     added flags -tn, -seed, -r
     the detailed information about failed tests is displayed right in the console.

>>> Bug fixes:

  - about 200 bugs have been fixed. For the list of closed and still open bugs, please look at
    https://code.ros.org/trac/opencv/report and
    http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=22870&atid=376677.    
  
>>> Known problems/limitations.

  - there are some sporadic test failures on different platforms.
    Most probably they are caused by some very special test cases
    (that are usually generated randomly on each test run) and the test cases
    are not properly handled by the functions or by the tests.
    Some of the tests have been reproduced and reported here:
    
    https://code.ros.org/trac/opencv/ticket/29
    https://code.ros.org/trac/opencv/ticket/113
    https://code.ros.org/trac/opencv/ticket/114
    
  - the new Python bindings do not include interface for the new C++ functionality and MLL.
    this is going to be addressed in some special intermediate OpenCV release
  
  - documentation is also incomplete at the moment and there are occasional formatting,
    grammar and semantical errors.
    We continue to improve it on a regular basis. Please, check the up-to-date online
    documentation at:
    
    http://opencv.willowgarage.com/documentation/c/index.html (C)
    http://opencv.willowgarage.com/documentation/cpp/index.html (C++)
    http://opencv.willowgarage.com/documentation/python/index.html (Python)
    
  - please also check the list of open bugs at
    https://code.ros.org/trac/opencv/report and
    http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=22870&atid=376677.

<hr><h2>2.0</h2>
<p class="Blurb"><i>(September, 2009)</i></p>

<pre>
>>> New functionality, features:

  - General:
    * Installation package on Windows has been fixed,
      MinGW is used for precompiled binaries
      (see the release notes on the SourceForge site)
      
    * autotools-based build has been repaired

  - MLL:
    * The new-style class aliases (e.g. cv::SVM ~ CvSVM) and the train/predict methods,
      taking cv::Mat in addition to CvMat, have been added. So now MLL can be used
      more seamlesly with the rest of the restyled OpenCV.

>>> Bug fixes:

  - A _lot_ of bugs present in 2.0 beta have been fixed, see the OpenCV bug tracker
    http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=22870&atid=376677
    Thanks to everybody who submitted bug reports and/or patches!
</pre>

<hr><h2>2.0 beta</h2>
<p class="Blurb"><i>(September, 2009)</i></p>

<pre>
>>> New functionality, features: <<<

  - General:
    * The brand-new C++ interface for most of OpenCV functionality
      (cxcore, cv, highgui) has been introduced.
      Generally it means that you will need to do less coding to achieve the same results;
      it brings automatic memory management and many other advantages.
      See the C++ Reference section in opencv/doc/opencv.pdf and opencv/include/opencv/*.hpp.
      The previous interface is retained and still supported.
      
    * The source directory structure has been reogranized; now all the external headers are placed
      in the single directory on all platforms.
      
    * The primary build system is CMake, http://www.cmake.org (2.6.x is the preferable version).
        + In Windows package the project files for Visual Studio, makefiles for MSVC,
          Borland C++ or MinGW are note supplied anymore; please, generate them using CMake.
      
        + In MacOSX the users can generate project files for Xcode.
        
        + In Linux and any other platform the users can generate project files for
          cross-platform IDEs, such as Eclipse or Code Blocks,
          or makefiles for building OpenCV from a command line.
          
    * OpenCV repository has been converted to Subversion, hosted at SourceForge:
      http://opencvlibrary.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/opencvlibrary
      where the very latest snapshot is at
      http://opencvlibrary.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/opencvlibrary/trunk,
      and the more or less stable version can be found at
      http://opencvlibrary.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/opencvlibrary/tags/latest_tested_snapshot
      
  - CXCORE, CV, CVAUX:
  
    * CXCORE now uses Lapack (CLapack 3.1.1.1 in OpenCV 2.0) in its various linear algebra functions
      (such as solve, invert, SVD, determinant, eigen etc.) and the corresponding old-style functions
      (cvSolve, cvInvert etc.)
  
    * Lots of new feature and object detectors and descriptors have been added
      (there is no documentation on them yet), see cv.hpp and cvaux.hpp:
      
      + FAST - the fast corner detector, submitted by Edward Rosten
      
      + MSER - maximally stable extremal regions, submitted by Liu Liu 
      
      + LDetector - fast circle-based feature detector by V. Lepetit (a.k.a. YAPE)
      
      + Fern-based point classifier and the planar object detector -
                       based on the works by M. Ozuysal and V. Lepetit
                       
      + One-way descriptor - a powerful PCA-based feature descriptor,
        (S. Hinterstoisser, O. Kutter, N. Navab, P. Fua, and V. Lepetit,
        "Real-Time Learning of Accurate Patch Rectification").
        Contributed by Victor Eruhimov
      
      + Spin Images 3D feature descriptor - based on the A. Johnson PhD thesis;
        implemented by Anatoly Baksheev
      
      + Self-similarity features - contributed by Rainer Leinhart
      
      + HOG people and object detector - the reimplementation of Navneet Dalal framework
        (http://pascal.inrialpes.fr/soft/olt/). Currently, only the detection part is ported,
        but it is fully compatible with the original training code.
        See cvaux.hpp and opencv/samples/c/peopledetect.cpp.
        
      + Extended variant of the Haar feature-based object detector - implemented by Maria Dimashova.
        It now supports Haar features and LBPs (local binary patterns);
        other features can be more or less easily added
        
      + Adaptive skin detector and the fuzzy meanshift tracker - contributed by Farhad Dadgostar,
        see cvaux.hpp and opencv/samples/c/adaptiveskindetector.cpp
    
    * The new traincascade application complementing the new-style HAAR+LBP object detector has been added.
      See opencv/apps/traincascade.
      
    * The powerful library for approximate nearest neighbor search FLANN by Marius Muja
      is now shipped with OpenCV, and the OpenCV-style interface to the library
      is included into cxcore. See cxcore.hpp and opencv/samples/c/find_obj.cpp
      
    * The bundle adjustment engine has been contributed by PhaseSpace; see cvaux.hpp
      
    * Added dense optical flow estimation function (based on the paper
      "Two-Frame Motion Estimation Based on Polynomial Expansion" by G. Farnerback).
      See cv::calcOpticalFlowFarneback and the C++ documentation
        
    * Image warping operations (resize, remap, warpAffine, warpPerspective)
      now all support bicubic and Lanczos interpolation.
      
    * Most of the new linear and non-linear filtering operations (filter2D, sepFilter2D, erode, dilate ...)
      support arbitrary border modes and can use the valid image pixels outside of the ROI
      (i.e. the ROIs are not "isolated" anymore), see the C++ documentation.
      
    * The data can now be saved to and loaded from GZIP-compressed XML/YML files, e.g.:
      cvSave("a.xml.gz", my_huge_matrix);
      
  - MLL:
    * Added the Extremely Random Trees that train super-fast,
      comparing to Boosting or Random Trees (by Maria Dimashova).
      
    * The decision tree engine and based on it classes
      (Decision Tree itself, Boost, Random Trees)
      have been reworked and now:
      + they consume much less memory (up to 200% savings)
      + the training can be run in multiple threads (when OpenCV is built with OpenMP support)
      + the boosting classification on numerical variables is especially
        fast because of the specialized low-overhead branch.
        
    * mltest has been added. While far from being complete,
      it contains correctness tests for some of the MLL classes.

  - HighGUI:
    * [Linux] The support for stereo cameras (currently Videre only) has been added.
      There is now uniform interface for capturing video from two-, three- ... n-head cameras.
      
    * Images can now be compressed to or decompressed from buffers in the memory,
      see the C++ HighGUI reference manual

  - Documentation:
    * The reference manual has been converted from HTML to LaTeX (by James Bowman and Caroline Pantofaru),
      so there is now:
      + opencv.pdf for reading offline
      + and the online up-to-date documentation
        (as the result of LaTeX->Sphinx->HTML conversion) available at
        http://opencv.willowgarage.com/documentation/index.html
        
  - Samples, misc.:
    * Better eye detector has been contributed by Shiqi Yu,
      see opencv/data/haarcascades/*[lefteye|righteye]*.xml
    * sample LBP cascade for the frontal face detection
      has been created by Maria Dimashova,
      see opencv/data/lbpcascades/lbpcascade_frontalface.xml
    * Several high-quality body parts and facial feature detectors
      have been contributed by Modesto Castrillon-Santana,
      see opencv/data/haarcascades/haarcascade_mcs*.xml
   
>>> Optimization:
    * Many of the basic functions and the image processing operations
      (like arithmetic operations, geometric image transformations, filtering etc.)
      have got SSE2 optimization, so they are several times faster.
      
    - The model of IPP support has been changed. Now IPP is supposed to be
      detected by CMake at the configuration stage and linked against OpenCV.
      (In the beta it is not implemented yet though).
      
    * PNG encoder performance improved by factor of 4 by tuning the parameters

>>> Bug fixes: <<<
    TBD
    (see http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=22870&atid=376677 of the list
    of the closed and still opened bugs).
    
    Many thanks to everybody who submitted bug reports and/or provided the patches!

>>> Known issues:
    * configure+autotools based build is currently broken.
      Please, use CMake.
    * OpenCV bug tracker at SF still lists about 150 open bugs.
      Some of them may be actually fixed already, and most of the remaining bugs
      are going to be fixed by OpenCV 2.0 gold.
    * IPP is not supported. As the new OpenCV includes a lot of SSE2 code,
      it may be not such a serious problem, though.
      The support (at least for most important functions that do not have
      SSE2 optimization) will be returned in 2.0 gold.
    * The documentation has been updated and improved a lot, but it still
      needs quite a bit of work:
        - some of the new functionality in cvaux is not described yet.
        - the bibliography part is broken
        - there are quite a few known bugs and typos there
        - many of the hyperlinks are not working.
    * The existing tests partly cover the new functionality
      (via the old backward-compatibility OpenCV 1.x API), but the coverage is
      not sufficient of course.
    * The new-style Python interface is not included yet  

    Many of the problems will be addressed in 2.0 gold.
    If you have found some specific problem, please, put the record to the bug tracker:
    http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=22870
    Better if the bug reports will include a small code sample in C++/python +
    all the necessary data files needed to reproduce the problem.

      TRS is not used by the tests anymore.
    
>>> Bug fixes: <<<
     Many thanks to everybody who submitted bug reports and/or provided the patches!

     * Incorrect normalization in cvFindFundamentalMat (SF #1550855)
     * Occasional cvGetQuadrangleSubPix crashes (SF #1549168)
     * Occasional cvCalcOpticalFlowPyrLK crashes
     * Internal GCC 3.x error in cvFloor/cvCeil (SF #1546657)
     * Several Python-related bugs (SF #1570109, SF #1572800, SF #1543593)
     * Bugs in contour processing/rendering (SF #1550889, 
     * x86-64 related bugs (SF #1526133, SF #1527997)
     * OpenCV dispatcher tried to load old versions of IPP (pre 4.x)
       that caused many failures (see SF #1555093, for example)
     * Inaccurate results in some cases in cvFitEllipse, cvFitLine, cvHoughCircles.
     * Severe bug in Bayesian classifier, broken regression tree in MLL
     * Overflow in blurring filter
     * cvSaveImage() modified saved images leading to potential problems in threaded apps.
     * Numeric values in XML/YAML were emitted/parsed incorrectly
       on some non-US locales in Linux
     * VS2005 Express/Standard Editions could not build OpenCV
       (due to missing OpenMP support)
     * ...

>>> Known issues:
    * Certain tests may fail on IA64 (Itanium), e.g.
      gaussian filter, fundamental matrix estimation, chessboard detector.
