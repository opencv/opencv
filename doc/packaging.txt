INSTRUCTIONS TO BUILD WIN32 PACKAGES WITH CMAKE+CPACK
------------------------------------------------------

- Install NSIS.
- Generate OpenCV solutions for MSVC using CMake as usual.
- In cmake-gui:
    - Mark BUILD_PACKAGE
    - Mark BUILD_EXAMPLES (If examples are desired to be shipped as binaries...)
    - Unmark ENABLE_OPENMP, since this feature seems to have some issues yet...
    - Mark INSTALL_*_EXAMPLES
- Open the OpenCV solution and build ALL in Debug and Release.
- Build PACKAGE, from the Release configuration. An NSIS installer package will be
  created with both release and debug LIBs and DLLs.
