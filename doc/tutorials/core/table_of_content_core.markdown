The Core Functionality (core module) {#tutorial_table_of_content_core}
=====================================

Here you will learn the about the basic building blocks of the library. A must read and know for
understanding how to manipulate the images on a pixel level.

-   @subpage tutorial_mat_the_basic_image_container

    *Languages:* C++

    *Compatibility:* \> OpenCV 2.0

    *Author:* Bernát Gábor

    You will learn how to store images in the memory and how to print out their content to the
    console.

-   @subpage tutorial_how_to_scan_images

    *Languages:* C++

    *Compatibility:* \> OpenCV 2.0

    *Author:* Bernát Gábor

    You'll find out how to scan images (go through each of the image pixels) with OpenCV.
    Bonus: time measurement with OpenCV.


-   @subpage tutorial_mat_mask_operations

    *Languages:* C++, Java, Python

    *Compatibility:* \> OpenCV 2.0

    *Author:* Bernát Gábor

    You'll find out how to scan images with neighbor access and use the @ref cv::filter2D
    function to apply kernel filters on images.

    *Languages:* C++, Python

    *Compatibility:* \> OpenCV 2.0

    *Author:* Bernát Gábor

    You will see how to use the @ref cv::FileStorage data structure of OpenCV to write and read
    data to XML or YAML file format.

-   @subpage tutorial_how_to_use_OpenCV_parallel_for_

    *Languages:* C++

    *Compatibility:* \>= OpenCV 2.4.3

    You will see how to use the OpenCV parallel_for_ to easily parallelize your code.
