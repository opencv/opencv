Goal
----

In this tutorial you will learn:

-   what a degradation image model is
-   what the PSF of an out-of-focus image is
-   how to restore a blurred image
-   what is a Wiener filter

Theory
------

@note The explanation is based on the books @cite Gonzalez1987 and @cite gruzman. Also, you can refer to Matlab's tutorial [Image Deblurring in Matlab] and the article [SmartDeblur].
@note The out-of-focus image on this page is a real world  image. The out-of-focus was achieved manually by camera optics.

### What is a degradation image model?

Here is a mathematical model of the image degradation in frequency domain representation:

\f[S = H\cdot U + N\f]

where
\f$S\f$ is a spectrum of blurred (degraded) image,
\f$U\f$ is a spectrum of original true (undegraded) image,
\f$H\f$ is a frequency response of point spread function (PSF),
\f$N\f$ is a spectrum of additive noise.

The circular PSF is a good approximation of out-of-focus distortion. Such a PSF is specified by only one parameter - radius \f$R\f$. Circular PSF is used in this work.

### How to restore a blurred image?

The objective of restoration (deblurring) is to obtain an estimate of the original image. The restoration formula in frequency domain is:

\f[U' = H_w\cdot S\f]

where
\f$U'\f$ is the spectrum of estimation of original image \f$U\f$, and
\f$H_w\f$ is the restoration filter, for example, the Wiener filter.

### What is the Wiener filter?

The Wiener filter is a way to restore a blurred image. Let's suppose that the PSF is a real and symmetric signal, a power spectrum of the original true image and noise are not known,
then a simplified Wiener formula is:

\f[H_w = \frac{H}{|H|^2+\frac{1}{SNR}} \f]

where
\f$SNR\f$ is signal-to-noise ratio.

So, in order to recover an out-of-focus image by Wiener filter, it needs to know the \f$SNR\f$ and \f$R\f$ of the circular PSF.


Source code
-----------

You can find source code in the `samples/cpp/tutorial_code/ImgProc/out_of_focus_deblur_filter/out_of_focus_deblur_filter.cpp` of the OpenCV source code library.

@include cpp/tutorial_code/ImgProc/out_of_focus_deblur_filter/out_of_focus_deblur_filter.cpp

Explanation
-----------

An out-of-focus image recovering algorithm consists of PSF generation, Wiener filter generation and filtering a blurred image in frequency domain:
@snippet samples/cpp/tutorial_code/ImgProc/out_of_focus_deblur_filter/out_of_focus_deblur_filter.cpp main

A function calcPSF() forms a circular PSF according to input parameter radius \f$R\f$:
@snippet samples/cpp/tutorial_code/ImgProc/out_of_focus_deblur_filter/out_of_focus_deblur_filter.cpp calcPSF

A function calcWnrFilter() synthesizes the simplified Wiener filter \f$H_w\f$ according to the formula described above:
@snippet samples/cpp/tutorial_code/ImgProc/out_of_focus_deblur_filter/out_of_focus_deblur_filter.cpp calcWnrFilter

A function fftshift() rearranges the PSF. This code was just copied from the tutorial @ref tutorial_discrete_fourier_transform "Discrete Fourier Transform":
@snippet samples/cpp/tutorial_code/ImgProc/out_of_focus_deblur_filter/out_of_focus_deblur_filter.cpp fftshift

A function filter2DFreq() filters the blurred image in the frequency domain:
@snippet samples/cpp/tutorial_code/ImgProc/out_of_focus_deblur_filter/out_of_focus_deblur_filter.cpp filter2DFreq

Result
------

Below you can see the real out-of-focus image:
![Out-of-focus image](images/original.jpg)


And the following result has been computed with \f$R\f$ = 53 and \f$SNR\f$ = 5200 parameters:
![The restored (deblurred) image](images/recovered.jpg)

The Wiener filter was used, and values of \f$R\f$ and \f$SNR\f$ were selected manually to give the best possible visual result.
We can see that the result is not perfect, but it gives us a hint to the image's content. With some difficulty, the text is readable.

@note The parameter \f$R\f$ is the most important. So you should adjust \f$R\f$ first, then \f$SNR\f$.
@note Sometimes you can observe the ringing effect in a restored image. This effect can be reduced with several methods. For example, you can taper input image edges.

You can also find a quick video demonstration of this on
