  abstract = {This work presents a new efficient method for fitting ellipses to scattered data. Previous algorithms either fitted general conics or were computationally expensive. By minimizing the algebraic distance subject to the constraint 4ac-b<sup>2</sup>=1, the new method incorporates the ellipticity constraint into the normalization factor. The proposed method combines several advantages: It is ellipse-specific, so that even bad data will always return an ellipse. It can be solved naturally by a generalized eigensystem. It is extremely robust, efficient, and easy to implement},

@article{taubin1991,
  abstract = {The author addresses the problem of parametric representation and estimation of complex planar curves in 2-D surfaces in 3-D, and nonplanar space curves in 3-D. Curves and surfaces can be defined either parametrically or implicitly, with the latter representation used here. A planar curve is the set of zeros of a smooth function of two variables <e1>x</e1>-<e1>y</e1>, a surface is the set of zeros of a smooth function of three variables <e1>x</e1>-<e1>y</e1>-<e1>z</e1>, and a space curve is the intersection of two surfaces, which are the set of zeros of two linearly independent smooth functions of three variables <e1>x</e1>-<e1>y</e1>-<e1>z</e1> For example, the surface of a complex object in 3-D can be represented as a subset of a single implicit surface, with similar results for planar and space curves. It is shown how this unified representation can be used for object recognition, object position estimation, and segmentation of objects into meaningful subobjects, that is, the detection of `interest regions' that are more complex than high curvature regions and, hence, more useful as features for object recognition},
