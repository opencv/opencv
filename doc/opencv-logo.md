The OpenCV logo was originally designed and contributed by Adi Shavit in 2006. The graphical part consists of three stylized letters O, C, V, colored in the primary R, G, B color components, used by humans and computers to perceive the world. It is shaped in a way to mimic the famous [Kanizsa's triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_contours) to emphasize that prior knowledge and internal processing are as important as the acquired “raw” data."

The restyled version of the logo was designed by [Xperience.ai](https://xperience.ai/) in July 2020 for the [20th anniversary](https://opencv.org/anniversary/) of OpenCV.


The logo uses [Exo 2](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Exo+2#about) font by Natanael Gama distributed under OFL license.

Higher-resolution version of the logo, as well as SVG version of it, can be obtained at OpenCV [Media Kit](https://opencv.org/resources/media-kit/).
